  <title>Helm Chart for Kubernetes Deployment</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Situation</h1>
  <p>During my previous employment, I was working in a mid-sized company with multiple environments (development, testing, production). We were transitioning to using Kubernetes for orchestrating our deployments, and it was quite a challenge to manage the Kubernetes manifests for the web application across all these environments. Additionally, we also wanted to ensure a smooth CI/CD pipeline and follow the GitOps approach.</p>

  <h1>Task</h1>
  <p>The main task was to design a Helm chart for deploying the web application with different configurations across our development, testing, and production environments, which can be integrated into a GitOps pipeline. This chart needed to cover a variety of Kubernetes resources including Deployments, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets, RBAC, Network Policies, Persistent Volumes, and others.</p>

  <h1>Action</h1>
  <p>To begin, I analyzed the requirements for each environment and created a <strong>values.yaml</strong> file for each (<strong>values.dev.yaml</strong>, <strong>values.test.yaml</strong>, <strong>values.prod.yaml</strong>) which contained environment-specific configurations. I then created templates for the Kubernetes resources in the Helm chart which referenced these values.</p>

  <p>For instance, the <strong>Deployment.yaml</strong> used the image and tag from the values file, the <strong>ConfigMap.yaml</strong> and <strong>Secret.yaml</strong> included the environment-specific configurations and sensitive data, and the <strong>Ingress.yaml</strong> managed the ingress rules. RBAC rules and service accounts were managed using <strong>Rbac.yaml</strong> and <strong>ServiceAccount.yaml</strong>. Network policies were enforced using <strong>NetworkPolicyIngress.yaml</strong> and <strong>NetworkPolicyEgress.yaml</strong>.</p>

  <p>The application's data was managed using <strong>PersistentVolumeClaim.yaml</strong> and <strong>PersistentVolume.yaml</strong>. I created a Helm chart that includes <strong>SealedSecrets.yaml</strong> to manage the encrypted secrets. I used <strong>PodDisruptionBudget.yaml</strong> to ensure high availability during voluntary disruptions.</p>

  <p>To ensure the Helm chart worked correctly, I performed Helm linting and testing. Once I was confident in the Helm chart, I integrated it into our GitOps pipeline.</p>

  <h1>Issue/Problem</h1>
  <p>One of the main issues encountered during this process was the handling of sensitive data across different environments. Storing sensitive data in plain text in Git was not acceptable due to security reasons.</p>

  <h1>Resolution</h1>
  <p>To solve this issue, we decided to use Kubernetes <strong>Sealed Secrets</strong>. We used <strong>SealedSecrets.yaml</strong> in our Helm chart for managing encrypted secrets. This allowed us to safely store and version control our secrets in Git without exposing sensitive information.</p>

  <h1>Result</h1>
  <p>The Helm chart significantly simplified our Kubernetes deployments across multiple environments. The use of Sealed Secrets provided a secure way to handle sensitive data. This resulted in smoother and faster deployment processes, fewer errors, and an overall increase in the efficiency of our DevOps practices. It was a successful implementation of the GitOps approach, and it greatly improved our ability to maintain and manage the application in various environments.</p>
