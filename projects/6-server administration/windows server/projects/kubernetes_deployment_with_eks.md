**Expert Role: Cloud Solutions Architect**

**Objective:** Provide guidance on architecting a cloud-native solution for deploying a containerized application using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

**Response:**

To architect a cloud-native solution for deploying a containerized application with Amazon EKS, you'll need to consider several key aspects. Here are the steps involved in building such a solution:

**1. Define the Application Architecture:**
- Identify the components and services required for your application.
- Determine the containerization strategy and define the container images, dependencies, and application-specific configurations.

**2. Design the Network Infrastructure:**
- Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with subnets across different Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability and fault tolerance.
- Configure security groups, network ACLs, and routing tables to control traffic flow and enhance security.

**3. Create an EKS Cluster:**
- Set up an EKS cluster to manage and orchestrate the deployment of containers.
- Determine the size and scaling requirements of your cluster based on anticipated workload and traffic patterns.

**4. Configure Cluster Access:**
- Define the authentication and authorization mechanisms to securely access and manage the EKS cluster.
- Set up AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, permissions, and user/group mappings.

**5. Define Kubernetes Deployments:**
- Define Kubernetes deployment manifests that describe the desired state of your application.
- Configure the number of replicas, resource requirements, and environment variables for each container.

**6. Implement Scaling and Updates:**
- Utilize Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically adjust the number of replicas based on CPU or custom metrics.
- Use Kubernetes Rolling Updates or Deployments with proper strategies to update your application without downtime.

**7. Load Balancing and Service Discovery:**
- Set up a Kubernetes Service and define the load balancer type to distribute traffic across pods.
- Leverage AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) integrations for external traffic routing.

**8. Implement Monitoring and Logging:**
- Set up monitoring solutions such as Prometheus and Grafana to collect and visualize metrics from your EKS cluster and applications.
- Configure container logging using tools like Fluentd or the Kubernetes API to gather and store container logs.

**9. Implement CI/CD Pipelines:**
- Utilize a CI/CD tool such as Jenkins or AWS CodePipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment of your containerized application on EKS.
- Integrate the CI/CD pipeline with your version control system and container registry.

**10. Security and Access Control:**
- Implement fine-grained access control using Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Secure your EKS cluster by regularly applying security patches and keeping up with the latest Kubernetes and EKS versions.

**Result:**
By following the above steps, you will architect a cloud-native solution for deploying a containerized application using Amazon EKS. The solution will provide scalability, manageability, and fault tolerance while leveraging the capabilities of Kubernetes and AWS services.

**Possible Questions:**
1. How can I implement automatic scaling based on custom metrics with EKS and Kubernetes?
2. What are the best practices for managing secrets and sensitive information in EKS?
3. Can you explain how to perform blue-green or canary deployments on EKS?
4. What options are available for persistent storage in EKS for stateful applications?
5. How can I configure EKS cluster autoscaler to automatically scale worker nodes based on pending pods?
