<h2>Situation:</h2>
<p>In my previous role as a DevOps engineer at XYZ Company, we had multiple Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers hosting numerous .NET applications. Each application had its own website configuration, application pool, and SSL certificate requirements. Manual management of these servers was becoming increasingly challenging and error-prone due to the scale and complexity of our infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Task:</h2>
<p>My task was to automate the process of managing our IIS web servers, including creating and configuring websites, managing application pools, and handling SSL certificates, with a PowerShell script to reduce human error and streamline our operations.</p>

<h2>Action:</h2>
<p>I wrote a PowerShell script that utilized various cmdlets of the WebAdministration module, which is designed to manage IIS. The script had functions to create a new website with a specific configuration, configure application pools, bind SSL certificates to the website, and restart IIS if needed. I made the script dynamic enough to take input parameters so that it could be used for different applications and environments.</p>

<h2>Issue/Problem:</h2>
<p>After implementing the PowerShell script, we noticed that occasionally, the script would fail, particularly during the SSL certificate binding step. The problem was traced back to situations where the script was trying to bind an SSL certificate that hadn't been fully imported into the certificate store yet.</p>

<h2>Resolution:</h2>
<p>To solve this issue, I updated the script to add a verification step after the SSL certificate import operation. This step ensured that the certificate was fully imported and available in the certificate store before the script attempted to bind it to a website. If the certificate was not ready, the script would pause and retry the operation after a few seconds.</p>

<h2>Result:</h2>
<p>As a result, we eliminated the inconsistencies and occasional failures during our IIS web server configuration process. The automation also dramatically reduced the time spent on these tasks and minimized the potential for human error. With the implementation of this PowerShell script, we saw an increase in productivity, reliability, and consistency across our IIS web servers. This also freed up our team to spend more time on other value-adding tasks and continuous improvement initiatives.</p>
