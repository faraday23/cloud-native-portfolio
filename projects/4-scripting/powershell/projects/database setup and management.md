Expert Role: IT Educator specializing in DevOps and Configuration Management

Objective: To provide an in-depth, comprehensive playbook using Ansible to automate database provisioning and management tasks, including installation and configuration, user and database creation, permission management, and database backups.

Response:

For this example, I'll use MySQL as the database system. This playbook is quite complex as it covers a wide range of tasks. Make sure to replace any necessary variables (`yourusername`, `yourpassword`, etc.) with your actual data.

```yaml
---
- name: MySQL setup and management
  hosts: db_servers
  become: yes
  vars:
    mysql_root_password: your_root_password
    mysql_db: your_database_name
    mysql_user: your_username
    mysql_password: your_password

  tasks:
    - name: Install MySQL Server
      apt: 
        name: mysql-server
        state: present
        update_cache: yes
      notify: Start MySQL

    - name: Install MySQL Python library
      apt:
        name: python3-mysqldb
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Update mysql root password for all root accounts
      mysql_user:
        name: root
        password: "{{ mysql_root_password }}"
        login_unix_socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
        check_implicit_admin: yes

    - name: Remove anonymous MySQL server user
      mysql_user:
        name: ''
        state: absent
        login_unix_socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

    - name: Remove MySQL test database
      mysql_db:
        name: test
        state: absent
        login_unix_socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

    - name: Create new MySQL database
      mysql_db:
        name: "{{ mysql_db }}"
        state: present

    - name: Create new MySQL user
      mysql_user:
        name: "{{ mysql_user }}"
        password: "{{ mysql_password }}"
        priv: "{{ mysql_db }}.*:ALL"
        state: present

    - name: Dump the database for backup
      mysql_db:
        name: "{{ mysql_db }}"
        state: dump
        target: /tmp/{{ mysql_db }}.sql

  handlers:
    - name: Start MySQL
      service:
        name: mysql
        state: started
...
```

Here's what each task does:

1. Installs the MySQL server and Python's MySQL library. 

2. Updates the MySQL root password. 

3. Removes anonymous users and the test database for security.

4. Creates a new MySQL database and user with all privileges on the new database.

5. Dumps (backs up) the database to a file.

The "Start MySQL" handler is notified after MySQL installation to ensure the service is running.

Remember, sensitive data (like passwords) should not be stored in plain text in your playbooks. Ansible Vault is a good tool for securely storing this information.

Possible Questions:

1. How can I restore the MySQL database from the backup file using Ansible?
2. How can I automate regular MySQL database backups using Ansible?
3. How can I manage multiple MySQL databases and users using Ansible?
4. How to encrypt the sensitive information like password in the Ansible playbook?
5. How can I check if a MySQL database or user already exists before creating them?
