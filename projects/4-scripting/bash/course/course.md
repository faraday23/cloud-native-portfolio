Each session

 could last about 90 minutes, and each week would ideally comprise of two theoretical and two practical sessions. The final four weeks would focus on applying all the concepts learned to a real-life project, reinforcing the acquired knowledge, and preparing for the final examination. Please let me know if you would like an outline for another course.
