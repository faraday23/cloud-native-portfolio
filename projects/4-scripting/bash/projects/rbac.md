Role-based access control (RBAC) can be implemented in Ansible by using Ansible roles. Ansible roles allow for the organization of tasks and related files into a coherent structure, facilitating code reuse and modularization. For the purpose of this walkthrough, we'll create user accounts, define roles, and assign permissions to those roles across multiple servers.

Here's an in-depth guide to achieve this:

**1. Ansible Installation:**

Install Ansible on your control node (the host from where Ansible is run). Depending on your operating system, the command to install Ansible may vary. For Ubuntu, use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible
```

**2. Configure Ansible:**

Create a new directory for your Ansible project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir ~/ansible-rbac && cd ~/ansible-rbac
```

Inside this directory, create an Ansible configuration file:

```bash
touch ansible.cfg
```

In this file, add:

```ini
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory.ini
```

This instructs Ansible to look for an inventory file in the same directory.

**3. Set Up the Inventory File:**

Create a new file named `inventory.ini`:

```bash
touch inventory.ini
```

In this file, add your servers:

```ini
[webservers]
192.0.2.0
192.0.2.1
```

Replace the above IP addresses with your actual server IP addresses.

**4. Create the Ansible Role:**

Navigate to the `ansible-rbac` directory. Here, create a roles directory, and within it, create the structure for the `user-management` role:

```bash
mkdir -p roles/user-management/{tasks,handlers,files,templates,vars,defaults,meta}
```

Each directory has a specific purpose:

- `tasks`: Contains the main list of tasks to be executed by the role.
- `handlers`: Contains handlers, which may be used by this role or even anywhere outside this role.
- `files`: Contains files that we may want to deploy via this role.
- `templates`: Contains templates which can be deployed via this role.
- `vars`: Contains other variables for the role.
- `defaults`: Default lower priority variables for this role.
- `meta`: Contains metadata of your role like the role's author, the company, or any other generic information.

**5. Define the Role's Tasks:**

In `roles/user-management/tasks`, create a new file named `main.yml`. This file will hold the tasks of the `user-management` role.

Define a task to create a group for each role:

```yaml
---
- name: Ensure group for each role exists
  group:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop: "{{ roles }}"
```

Next, define a task to create a user for each role and add them to the appropriate group:

```yaml
- name: Ensure user for each role exists and belongs to the role's group
  user:
    name: "{{ item.name }}"
    group: "{{ item.role }}"
    state: present
  loop: "{{ users }}"
```

**6. Define Your Roles and Users:**

In `roles/user-management/defaults`, create a new file named `main.yml`. This file will hold the default variables for the `user-management` role.

Define your roles and users:

```yaml
---
roles:
  - admin
  - developer

users:
  - name: alice
    role: admin
  - name: bob
    role: developer
```

**7. Create a Master Playbook:**

In the `ansible-rbac` directory
