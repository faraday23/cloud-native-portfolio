# This script is an example of how to use APIs from other applications or services to perform complex automation tasks. The script makes a request to an API endpoint to get weather data, uses the jq command to parse the data and extract relevant information, and then sends the information to a social media platform using another API endpoint.

# To use this script, you would need to replace https://api.example.com/weather with the endpoint for the weather API, API_KEY_HERE with your API key for the weather API, and https://api.example.com/social-media with the endpoint for the social media API. You would also need to replace ACCESS_TOKEN with your access token for the social media API.

#!/bin/bash

# API Script Example

# Define variables for the API endpoint and authentication information
api_endpoint="https://api.example.com/weather"
api_key="API_KEY_HERE"

response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $api_endpoint)
if [ $response -ne 200 ]; then
    echo "API returned error $response"
    exit 1
fi

# Make a request to the API to get the weather data
weather_data=$(curl -s -X GET -H "Authorization: $api_key" $api_endpoint)

# Parse the weather data to extract the relevant information
temp=$(echo $weather_data | jq -r '.temperature' 2>/dev/null || echo "ERROR")
if [ "$temp" = "ERROR" ]; then
    echo "Error parsing JSON data"
    exit 1
fi

humidity=$(echo $weather_data | jq -r '.humidity' 2>/dev/null || echo "ERROR")
if [ "$temp" = "ERROR" ]; then
    echo "Error parsing JSON data"
    exit 1
fi

wind_speed=$(echo $weather_data | jq -r '.wind_speed' 2>/dev/null || echo "ERROR")
if [ "$temp" = "ERROR" ]; then
    echo "Error parsing JSON data"
    exit 1
fi

# Send the weather data to a social media platform
message="Current weather: temperature $temp F, humidity $humidity%, wind speed $wind_speed mph"
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" -d "message=$message" https://api.example.com/social-media

# Print a message indicating that the script has completed
echo "API Script Example completed."
