Here are 10 in-depth Python interview questions with sample answers: 

1) What are the differences between tuples and lists?

Tuples are immutable while lists are mutable. Tuples use parentheses () while lists use square brackets []. Tuples typically use less memory than lists and are faster. Tuples are suitable for storing fixed data while lists are good for storing data that may change.

2) Explain what is object-oriented programming in Python?

Object-oriented programming refers to organizing code around data structures called objects. Objects contain both data fields (attributes) and functions (methods). This allows for data encapsulation where the data is hidden inside the object. Some key OOP concepts in Python are:

- Classes: Defines the blueprint for objects
- Inheritance: Ability to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class
- Polymorphism: Ability of objects to take on multiple forms
- Encapsulation: Bundling data into a single unit and hiding its implementation

3) What are magic methods in Python?

Magic methods in Python are special functions with double underscores at the beginning and end, e.g. __init__(). They are automatically invoked by Python in certain situations. Some examples are:

- __init__() - Called when an object is created  
- __add__() - Called when "+" operator is used  
- __len__() - Called when "len()" is used
- __repr__() - Called when the "repr()" function is used
- __del__() - Called when an object is deleted

Magic methods allow us to define custom behavior when these operations are performed.

4) Explain what is a context manager in Python?

A context manager is an object that defines actions to be performed when entering and exiting a context. It is used with the 'with' statement in Python. Some example uses are:

- File handling: Opening and closing files automatically  
- Database connections: Connecting and disconnecting from a database 
- Locks: Acquiring and releasing locks  
- Memory management: Allocating and freeing memory

The basic functions of a context manager are:

- `__enter__()` - Called when entering the context
- `__exit__()`  - Called when exiting the context

This allows us to define cleanup actions that are always performed, even if an exception occurs.

5) What is the difference between range() and enumerate() functions?

- range():  Used to generate a sequence of numbers. It does not actually produce a list, instead it returns a range object. This is memory efficient for large sequences.

- enumerate(): Used to iterate over an iterable and return indexes along with the values. It produces both indexes and values in a single step using tuples.

For example:
```python
lst = ['a', 'b', 'c']

for i in range(len(lst)):
    print(i, lst[i]) # 0 a  1 b 2 c   
```
    
Using enumerate():    
```python
for i, value in enumerate(lst):
    print(i, value) # 0 a  1 b  2 c   
```
enumerate() is more convenient when iterating over a list.

6) Explain what is a lambda function in Python?

A lambda function is a small anonymous function. It can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. It is used where the function is needed for a short time. Some examples:

```python
sum = lambda a, b : a + b
print(sum(2,3)) # 5

square = lambda x: x * x  
print(square(2)) # 4
```

Lambda functions are often used in combination with functions that requires function objects as arguments like filter(), map() etc. They are useful for making simple functions "on the fly".

7) Describe what is yield in Python.

The yield keyword is used to define a generator function. It pauses the function saving all the states and later resumes from there on next call. Some characteristics are:

- Defines a function that generates a sequence of results instead of a single value  
- Execution is suspended and variables remain in memory  
- Performance benefits over lists as values are generated on demand

Syntax:
```python
def generate_sequence():
   for i in range(5):
       yield i * i
```     
Usage:      
```python
result = generate_sequence()
next(result) # Returns 0  
next(result) # Returns 1
...
```

This allows values to be generated one at a time. Memory is freed up between iterations.

8) Explain decorator functions in Python.

A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and extends the behavior of the original function without modifying it. They allow you to wrap a function and extend its behavior.

Syntax:
```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        # Do something before
        func()
        # Do something after  
    return wrapper

@decorator      
def say_whee():
    print('Whee!')
```
Equivalent to:      
`say_whee = decorator(say_whee)`

When the function is called it will first execute the code in the decorator and then call the original function.

Decorators are useful for:

- Authentication 
- Caching  
- Logging 
- Timing/Profiling functions

9) Explain what is inheritance in Python.

Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. The main benefits are:

- Code reusability: We can reuse code from the parent class
- It is time saving: No need to rewrite the same code again. 
- It provides extensibility: The child class can add more methods.

Syntax:
```python 
class Parent:    
  # code

class Child(Parent): 
  # code  
```
The `Child` class inherits all the properties and methods from the `Parent` class. We can also override methods of the parent class. 

Some terminology:

- Parent class: The class being inherited from, also called base class.
- Child class: The class that inherits from another class, also called derived class. 
- Superclass: Another name for the parent class.
- Subclass: Another name for the child class.

10) What are metaclasses in Python?

A metaclass is a class which creates a class. A normal class creates instances, while a metaclass creates class.

When we define a class, Python internally calls its metaclass' `__new__()` and `__init__()` methods to create the class. The default metaclass is `type()`.

We can define our own metaclass to customize class creation. For example:

- Enforce a particular behavior for any class created  
- Add new functionalities to all classes
- Add attributes to a class when it is created 
- Modify a class when it is created

Syntax:
```python
class Meta(type):
    # ...
  
class Foo(metaclass=Meta):
    # ... 
```
Here `Meta` is the metaclass and `Foo` is using it.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

It seems you have answered a behavioral question regarding your experience with creating a chaos engineering script in Python for Kubernetes applications. Based on your scenario, I'm going to provide some Python-focused questions along with sample answers:

1. **Question: How would you handle exceptions in Python?**
   *Answer*: Python provides the try/except construct to catch and handle exceptions. Code that could potentially throw an exception is placed in the `try` block, and the handling of the exception is done in the corresponding `except` block. We also have `finally` block, where we can specify actions that must be executed irrespective of whether an exception has occurred or not.

2. **Question: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?**
   *Answer*: The main difference is that lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content without changing their identity. In contrast, tuples are immutable, which means you cannot change a tuple once it's been created. Another difference is their syntax – list elements are enclosed in square brackets, whereas tuple elements are enclosed in parentheses.

3. **Question: How would you manage application dependencies in Python?**
   *Answer*: Dependencies in Python are often managed by using `pip`, Python's package manager, along with a `requirements.txt` file which lists all of the dependencies required by the application with their appropriate versions.

4. **Question: What is a dictionary in Python?**
   *Answer*: A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. It's a built-in datatype that allows for the storage of data pairs such that they can be retrieved using the key. You can modify, view, lookup, and delete key-value pairs in a dictionary.

5. **Question: Can you explain how Python's garbage collection works?**
   *Answer*: Python's garbage collector works by counting the number of references to an object. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it means it's not accessible from anywhere in the program, and it can be safely deleted.

6. **Question: Can you explain how list comprehension works in Python?**
   *Answer*: List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It’s a syntactic construct that enables lists to be created from other lists by applying an expression to each element in the initial list.

7. **Question: How does multithreading work in Python?**
   *Answer*: Python threading allows you to have different parts of your program to run concurrently and can simplify your design. However, due to Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), in CPython, which is the reference implementation of Python used by many, threading may not speed up all tasks. It's more beneficial for IO-bound tasks rather than CPU-bound tasks.

8. **Question: How does error logging work in Python?**
   *Answer*: Python has a built-in module `logging` for logging errors. You can capture different severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and output them to different targets (console, files, HTTP GET/POST locations).

9. **Question: Can you explain how context managers work in Python and a scenario where you have used it?**
   *Answer*: Context managers allow setup and cleanup actions to be taken for objects when their creation is paired with the `with` keyword. A common use-case is for file operations where it ensures that the file is properly closed after operations are completed, even if exceptions occur.

10. **Question: How does a generator work in Python and when would you use one?**
   *Answer*: Generators are a special type of function that return an iterable sequence of results. Instead of returning all results at once, they yield one result at a time, pausing in between. This can be useful for large data sets where memory efficiency is of concern, as they generate values on the fly and don’t store all values in memory.
   
Remember, it's good to share specific experiences or projects where you have used these Python concepts.
