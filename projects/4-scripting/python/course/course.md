4: Examination Preparation

Each session would last approximately 90 minutes, and each week would ideally consist of two theoretical and two practical sessions. The final four weeks would concentrate on implementing all the learned concepts into a real-life project, consolidating the knowledge gained, and preparing for the final examination. Let me know if you need an outline for another course.
