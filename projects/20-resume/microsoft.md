  <h1>Situation:</h1>
  <p>
    I was supporting a customer who needed to migrate their on-premises Exchange server to Office 365.
  </p>

  <h1>Task:</h1>
  <p>
    Configure and migrate the customer's Exchange environment to Office 365.
  </p>

  <h1>Action:</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Created an Office 365 tenant and licenses for the users
    </li>
    <li>
      Configured Azure AD Connect to synchronize on-premises Active Directory with Azure AD
    </li>
    <li>
      Set up hybrid authentication to allow on-premises and Office 365 users to authenticate securely
    </li>
    <li>
      Created mailboxes and migrated user data using the Exchange Online Migration wizard
    </li>
    <li>
      Configured Exchange transport rules and mail flow settings in Office 365
    </li>
    <li>
      Tested email functionality and resolved any issues
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Issue:</h1>
  <p>
    The customer had a complex on-premises Exchange environment with multiple forests, databases, and mail routing rules.
  </p>

  <h1>Resolution:</h1>
  <p>
    I broke the migration into phases, starting with non-critical users and mailboxes. I worked closely with the customer to identify and replicate complex rules and settings in Office 365.
  </p>

  <h1>Result:</h1>
  <p>
    The customer now has a fully functional and secure Exchange Online environment. The phased approach and close collaboration minimized disruption and issues during the migration. The customer now benefits from the scalability, reliability, and lower costs of Office 365.
