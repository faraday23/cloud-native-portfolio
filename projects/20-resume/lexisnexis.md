  <h1><strong>Situation:</strong></h1>
  <p>
    I was working as a senior DevOps engineer on a project that involved building an internal web application that allows employees to access and manage their company benefits. The web application was hosted in an AKS cluster and was composed of multiple microservices such as user management, claims management, and plan management.
  </p>

  <h1><strong>Task:</strong></h1>
  <p>
    My task was to design and implement a solution architecture that would enable the web application to run on AKS with high availability, scalability, security, and performance.
  </p>

  <h1><strong>Action:</strong></h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Used Azure DevOps to create a CI/CD pipeline that would trigger on every code change in the Git repository and run unit tests, code quality checks, security scans, and deployment stages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Used Docker to containerize the application components and deploy them on AKS using Helm charts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Used Azure Load Balancer with Nginx to load balance the traffic to the web application and ensure zero downtime.
    </li>
    <li>
      Used Azure Active Directory to authenticate the users and control access to the web application.
    </li>
    <li>
      Used Azure Virtual Network and Network Security Groups to restrict the network access to the AKS cluster and the web application.
    </li>
    <li>
      Used Azure MySQL Flex Server to store the application data and ensure high availability and scalability.
    </li>
    <li>
      Used Azure Monitor to monitor the performance of the web application and alert on any issues.
    </li>
    <li>
      Used Azure Container Registry to store and manage the Docker images used by the application.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h1><strong>Issue/Problem:</strong></h1>
  <p>
    One of the challenges I faced was how to ensure the consistency and reliability of the deployments across different environments (development, testing, production) and regions (US, Europe, Asia).
  </p>

  <h1><strong>Resolution:</strong></h1>
  <p>
    I resolved this issue by using GitOps methodology to manage the deployments of the web application. I used Git as the single source of truth for the configuration and state of the web application. I used Flux as a GitOps operator that would sync the changes in the Git repository with the AKS cluster and apply them automatically. I used Kustomize as a tool that would customize the configuration for each environment and region based on overlays. I used Argo CD as a dashboard that would show the status of the deployments and allow me to rollback if needed.
  </p>

  <h1><strong>Result:</strong></h1>
  <p>
    As a result of my actions, I was able to build an internal web application that allows employees to access and manage their company benefits. The web application was running on AKS with high availability, scalability, security, and performance. The pipeline also enabled faster feedback loops and easier maintenance of the codebase.
