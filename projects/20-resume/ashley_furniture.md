  <h1>Situation:</h1>
  <p>
    I was recently tasked with improving the performance and scalability of our enterprise e-commerce website hosted on Azure.
  </p>

  <h1>Task:</h1>
  <p>
    Architect a solution utilizing Azure PaaS services to provide elastic scale, high availability, and performance improvements.
  </p>

  <h1>Action:</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Azure Traffic Manager to route users to the optimal App Service instance based on location
    </li>
    <li>
      Multiple Azure App Service instances in different regions to provide high availability
    </li>
    <li>
      Azure Cache for Redis to cache search results and frequently accessed data to improve performance
    </li>
    <li>
      Azure Search to provide a scalable search service for products
    </li>
    <li>
      Azure SQL Database to store product catalog and order data
    </li>
    <li>
      Azure Blob Storage to host product images
    </li>
    <li>
      Azure Application Insights for monitoring performance
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Issue:</h1>
  <p>
    The original website hosted on a single Azure Web App had issues with slow response times during peak loads and was only in one region.
  </p>

  <h1>Resolution:</h1>
  <p>
    By utilizing multiple Azure PaaS services, I was able to architect a scalable, highly available, and improved performance solution. Traffic Manager enabled elastic scaling by routing to the least-loaded App Service. Multiple regions provided high availability. Caching with Redis and Azure Search improved performance.
  </p>

  <h1>Result:</h1>
  <p>
    The new architecture based on my design has resulted in improved response times during peak loads, higher up-time with the multi-region approach, and the ability to scale easily as traffic increases. The enterprise e-commerce site is now a more reliable digital experience for our customers.
