<h1>Task:</h1>
<p><b>I was tasked with leading a team to transition our application to a more scalable and reliable infrastructure. The goals were to ensure seamless scalability to accommodate increasing traffic, improve application performance, and implement a robust monitoring system.</b></p>

<h1>Action:</h1>
<p><b>I proposed using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to orchestrate and manage our containerized applications. AKS's auto-scaling feature would handle increased traffic, and its self-healing capabilities would improve reliability. For application monitoring and analytics, I chose Application Insights due to its comprehensive view of application performance and its integration with Azure.</b></p>

Integrating Application Insights with a .NET application involves a few steps.

**Step 1: Install Application Insights**

Firstly, you need to install the Application Insights SDK for .NET applications. This can be done using the NuGet package manager:

```bash
Install-Package Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore
```

**Step 2: Add Instrumentation Key**

Next, you need to add the Instrumentation Key to your application's configuration. The Instrumentation Key is a unique identifier for your Application Insights resource. You can find it in the Azure portal under your Application Insights resource.

Add the Instrumentation Key in your `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "ApplicationInsights": {
    "InstrumentationKey": "your-instrumentation-key-here"
  },
  // Other settings
}
```

**Step 3: Configure Application Insights**

In your `Startup.cs` file, make sure to add Application Insights services in the `ConfigureServices` method:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Other services...

    // Add Application Insights services into service collection
    services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry();

    // More services...
}
```

**Step 4: Use Application Insights**

Application Insights is now ready to use. It will automatically collect a variety of telemetry data, such as request rates, response times, failure rates, etc.

If you want to track custom events or metrics, you can use the `TelemetryClient` class:

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private TelemetryClient _telemetryClient;

    public HomeController(TelemetryClient telemetryClient)
    {
        _telemetryClient = telemetryClient;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        // Track a custom event
        _telemetryClient.TrackEvent("HomePageVisited");

        return View();
    }
}
```

**Step 5: View Telemetry Data**

You can view the collected telemetry data in the Azure portal. Navigate to your Application Insights resource and explore the different tabs like 'Performance', 'Failures', 'Users', etc.

**Step 6: Set Up Alerts**

You can also set up alerts in the Azure portal. For example, you can create an alert to notify you when the server response time exceeds a certain threshold or when an unhandled exception occurs.

**Note**: Always remember to replace `"your-instrumentation-key-here"` with your actual Application Insights Instrumentation Key. The exact steps may vary slightly depending on the specifics of your .NET application.
