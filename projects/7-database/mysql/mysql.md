<h3>Situation</h3>
<p>I was tasked with building an electricity bill payment system for a local utility company using MySQL and Django, a Python web framework. The system needed to store information including customers, meters, readings, tariffs, bills, payments, etc., and provide an interface for employees and customers to interact with the data.</p>

<h3>Task</h3>
<p>I was responsible for designing and implementing a robust database schema using MySQL and creating a front-end interface using Django, enabling customers to view their bills and make payments.</p>

<h3>Action</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Gathering Requirements</h4>
<p>I collaborated with stakeholders to understand the project's full scope and the data that needed to be stored and managed.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Designing Logical Database Schema</h4>
<p>I identified the main entities such as customers, meters, readings, tariffs, bills, and payments. Here's a simplified Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Entities:</strong> Customers, Meters, Readings, Tariffs, Bills, Payments.</li>
    <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Customers have meters; meters have readings; tariffs apply to bills; bills have payments.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 3: Normalizing Database Schema</h4>
<p>I normalized the database following 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF rules to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.</p>

<h4>Step 4: Translating to Physical Database Schema</h4>
<p>I translated the logical schema into MySQL, creating tables as follows:</p>
<pre>
-- Customer Table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    contact VARCHAR(100)
    -- Other fields...
);

-- Meter Table
CREATE TABLE meters (
    meter_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    -- Other fields...
);

-- Readings Table
CREATE TABLE readings (
    reading_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    meter_id INT REFERENCES meters(meter_id),
    reading_value DECIMAL(10,2),
    date TIMESTAMP
    -- Other fields...
);

-- Other tables for Tariffs, Bills, Payments...
</pre>

<h4>Step 5: Writing SQL Queries</h4>
<p>I wrote SQL queries for CRUD operations and implemented views, functions, and triggers to handle complex queries.</p>

<h4>Step 6: Building Web Application with Django</h4>
<p>I used Django to build the web application, with the following structure:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Models:</strong> I defined models in Django to interact with MySQL, using Django's ORM.</li>
    <li><strong>Views:</strong> I created views to handle HTTP requests and responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Templates:</strong> I designed templates for the user interface, including pages for viewing bills, making payments, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> I implemented user authentication to secure logins.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 7: Testing</h4>
<p>I tested the system, fixing bugs and issues as they arose.</p>

<h3>Issue: Dealing with Concurrent Transactions</h3>
<p>The challenge was to ensure data consistency when customers made simultaneous payments.</p>

<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>I implemented transaction isolation and locking mechanisms in MySQL:</p>
<pre>
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM bills WHERE bill_id = 1 FOR UPDATE; -- Locks the record
-- Process the payment
COMMIT; -- Releases the lock
</pre>

<h3>Result</h3>
<p>I successfully built an efficient and user-friendly electricity bill payment system that handled operations such as bill generation, discount application, due calculation, and provided an intuitive interface for customers and employees. The stakeholders were satisfied, and the system was successfully implemented.</p>
