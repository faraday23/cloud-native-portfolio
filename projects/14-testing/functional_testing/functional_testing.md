To provide a comprehensive answer, I would like to clarify the specific requirements for the 14-week course. What are the primary objectives and goals of this course, and are there any prerequisites or specific target audience?

Based on the general idea of designing a 14-week course for functional testing in cloud environments, I would recommend structuring the course into the following modules, with each module covering specific topics:
