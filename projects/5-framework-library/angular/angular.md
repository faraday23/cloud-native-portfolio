<h2>Situation:</h2>
<p>You work as a DevOps engineer for a company that develops web applications. The development team wants to modernize one of their applications and migrate it to an Angular JavaScript framework.</p>

<h2>Task:</h2>
<p>The team has asked you to evaluate Angular as a potential framework and provide recommendations to implement it for this application.</p>

<h2>Action:</h2>
<p>You decide to set up a proof-of-concept Angular application to test and evaluate the framework.</p>

<h2>Issue/Problem:</h2>
<p>While developing the prototype, you realize the build times for the Angular app are very slow, taking several minutes. This would not scale for the production application.</p>

<h2>Resolution:</h2>
<p>You implement the following to optimize the build performance:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the <strong>--aot</strong> flag to compile the Angular templates into JS during the build. This speeds up production builds.</li>
  <li>Enable Bazel caching to reuse build results between runs.</li>
  <li>Leverage code chunking and lazy loading of modules to reduce initial bundle size.</li>
  <li>Split the library code into a separate library to optimize reuse.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Result:</h2>
<p>With these optimizations in place, the build times for the Angular application have been reduced to under 30 seconds. This shows Angular can meet the performance requirements for the existing application. You recommend that the development team proceed with adopting Angular for this application migration, as the framework will provide benefits like component architecture, two-way data binding, and a large ecosystem.</p>
