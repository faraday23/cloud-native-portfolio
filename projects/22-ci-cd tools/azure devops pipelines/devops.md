**Situation:** 
At a previous job, there was a large .NET Core microservices application deployed as containers to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. The CI/CD process via Azure DevOps Pipelines was inefficient, leading to prolonged build times.

**Task:** 
Optimize the CI/CD process to enhance developer productivity and hasten the deployment process.

**Action:** 

1. **Discovery Phase:** 
    - **Goal:** Understand the current state of the pipeline.
    - I studied the Azure DevOps Pipelines logs and metrics to pinpoint bottlenecks.
    - Checked for tasks that were time-consuming or redundant.

2. **Parallel Builds:** 
    - **Goal:** Exploit concurrency to reduce build times.
    - **Code Snippet:** In the YAML pipeline, jobs that don't depend on each other can be run concurrently.
    ```yaml
    jobs:
    - job: BuildJob1
      steps:
      - script: echo Building Job 1!
    - job: BuildJob2
      steps:
      - script: echo Building Job 2!
    ```
    Both `BuildJob1` and `BuildJob2` will run in parallel, as they don't have dependencies.

3. **Caching:** 
    - **Goal:** Minimize redundant operations by leveraging caching.
    - **Code Snippet for NuGet Caching:**
    ```yaml
    steps:
    - task: Cache@2
      inputs:
        key: 'nuget | "$(Agent.OS)" | path/to/your.csproj'
        restoreKeys: |
          nuget | "$(Agent.OS)"
        path: $(Pipeline.Workspace)/.nuget/packages
    - script: dotnet restore path/to/your.csproj
    ```
    - **Code Snippet for Docker Layer Caching:**
    ```yaml
    steps:
    - task: Cache@2
      inputs:
        key: 'docker | "$(Agent.OS)" | Dockerfile'
        restoreKeys: |
          docker | "$(Agent.OS)"
        path: $(DOCKER_CONFIG)/path
    - script: docker build -t your_image_name .
    ```

4. **Selective Builds:** 
    - **Goal:** Only build/test microservices that have changes.
    - **Code Snippet:**
    ```yaml
    jobs:
    - job: ConditionalBuild
      steps:
      - script: |
          # Use git to check changed files
          CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~)
          if echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -q "path/to/microservice1"; then
            echo "Microservice1 has changes"
            dotnet build path/to/microservice1
          fi
    ```

5. **Pipeline as Code:** 
    - **Goal:** Ensure pipeline changes are versioned, reviewed, and managed like application code.
    - I transitioned from the visual designer in Azure DevOps to YAML-based pipelines.
    - Stored the YAML definitions in the same repository, ensuring that pipeline changes went through the same review process as code changes.
    - **Code Snippet (Basic YAML Pipeline for .NET Core):**
    ```yaml
    trigger:
    - master

    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

    variables:
      buildConfiguration: 'Release'

    steps:
    - script: dotnet build --configuration $(buildConfiguration)
      displayName: 'dotnet build $(buildConfiguration)'
    ```

**Result:** 
After these optimizations, the CI/CD process was notably faster. Developers received feedback more quickly, deployments to AKS were more frequent, and the overall productivity of the teams improved.
