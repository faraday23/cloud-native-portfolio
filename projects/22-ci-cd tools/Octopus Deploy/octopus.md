  <title>DevOps Engineer Experience</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Situation:</h1>
  <p>I was working as a devops engineer for a company that developed a .NET application for microservices using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. The application consisted of a web front end and a database that contained the business logic and data.</p>
  
  <h1>Task:</h1>
  <p>My task was to implement a continuous delivery pipeline for the application using Octopus Deploy and TeamCity. The pipeline had to support automated builds, deployments to different environments, and sign offs for production deployments.</p>
  
  <h1>Action:</h1>
  <p>I used TeamCity to build the code and run unit tests, and I used Octopus Deploy to deploy and promote releases. I configured TeamCity to trigger a build whenever there was a code change in Git, and to push the build artifacts to Octopus Deploy. I also configured Octopus Deploy to create a release from the artifacts and deploy it to the dev environment automatically. For the test and production environments, I set up some rules in Octopus Deploy to control who can deploy and when. I also added some steps in Octopus Deploy to perform database migrations, run smoke tests, and send email notifications.</p>
  
  <h1>Issue/Problem:</h1>
  <p>One of the challenges I faced was how to handle configuration settings for different environments. The application had some settings that varied depending on the environment, such as connection strings, API keys, and feature flags. I did not want to hardcode these settings in the code or store them in plain text files.</p>
  
  <h1>Resolution:</h1>
  <p>I solved this problem by using variables in Octopus Deploy. Variables are placeholders that can be replaced with different values depending on the environment or other conditions. I defined variables for each configuration setting in Octopus Deploy, and assigned them different values for each environment. I also used variable scoping to limit the scope of variables to specific environments or steps. Then, I used variable substitution features in Octopus Deploy to replace the variables with their values in the configuration files during deployment.</p>
  
  <h1>Result:</h1>
  <p>As a result of my actions, I was able to implement a reliable and repeatable continuous delivery pipeline for the .NET application using Octopus Deploy and TeamCity. The pipeline improved the speed and quality of software delivery, as well as the collaboration between development and operations teams. The pipeline also reduced manual errors and ensured consistency across environments by using variables for configuration settings.</p>

    <li><strong>Run</strong> the Ansible playbook against the deployment server(s) to configure TeamCity using the command <code>ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini teamcity.yml</code>.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h1>Step 5: Configure Octopus Deploy with Ansible</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Create</strong> an Ansible playbook (e.g., <code>octopus.yml</code>) to automate the configuration of Octopus Deploy.</li>
    <li><strong>Define</strong> tasks to install and configure Octopus Deploy, including creating projects, environments, and deployment processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Utilize</strong> Ansible's modules to manage configurations, configure users and permissions, and handle any necessary environment-specific settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Run</strong> the Ansible playbook against the deployment server(s) to configure Octopus Deploy using the command <code>ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini octopus.yml</code>.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h1>Step 6: Set Up Continuous Integration and Delivery Pipeline</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Configure</strong> TeamCity to trigger builds on code changes and run unit tests using the TeamCity web interface or TeamCity's REST API.</li>
    <li><strong>Set up</strong> Octopus Deploy to automatically create releases and deploy them to the dev environment upon successful builds.</li>
    <li><strong>Define</strong> the necessary deployment steps, rules, and permissions for the test and production environments in Octopus Deploy.</li>
    <li><strong>Customize</strong> the deployment processes in Octopus Deploy to include database migrations, smoke tests, and notifications.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h1>Step 7: Test and Iterate</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Test</strong> the continuous delivery pipeline by making code changes, observing the automated build and deployment processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Iterate</strong> and refine the pipeline as necessary, making adjustments based on feedback and real-world usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Use</strong> Ansible and Terraform to make any necessary updates or modifications to the infrastructure or deployment configurations.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>By following these steps, you can configure the continuous delivery pipeline using Ansible and Terraform, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in your infrastructure and deployment processes. Remember to customize the configurations and playbooks according to your specific needs and requirements.</p>

  <h1>How to Configure the Continuous Delivery Pipeline Using Configuration Management Tools</h1>
  <p>Continuous delivery is an approach of producing software in such a manner that the software can be readily/continuously released whenever required. It enables the code to be in a deployable state, always & on demand. It diminishes the risk involved in delivering the changes as it uses the method of deployment in small repetitive incremental cycles and thus reducing the time & expense involved.</p>
  <p>However, continuous delivery also poses some challenges, such as managing complex and dynamic infrastructure, ensuring consistency and reliability across environments, and coordinating multiple teams and tools. This is where configuration management tools come in handy. Configuration management tools allow us to define, automate, and orchestrate the infrastructure and software components needed for the deployment pipeline.</p>
  
  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>Before we start, we need to install and set up Ansible and Terraform on our deployment server or a dedicated machine. We also need to have access to a cloud provider account where we will provision our infrastructure resources.</p>
  <p>To install Ansible, follow the instructions <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p>To install Terraform, follow the instructions <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli">here</a>.</p>
  <p>To verify that the tools are properly configured and accessible from the command line, run the following commands:</p>
  <pre><code>ansible --version
terraform --version
</code></pre>
  
  <h2>Infrastructure as Code with Terraform</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a Terraform configuration file (e.g., <code>main.tf</code>) to define the infrastructure needed for the deployment pipeline. In this example, we will create a simple configuration that provisions a virtual machine, a network, a security group, and an SSH key pair on AWS.</li>
    <li>Specify the required variables in a separate variables file (e.g., <code>variables.tfvars</code>) to make the configuration flexible and reusable.</li>
    <li>Run <code>terraform init</code> to initialize the Terraform project and download any required plugins.</li>
    <li>Run <code>terraform apply -var-file=variables.tfvars</code> to apply the configuration and create the infrastructure resources.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Provisioning Deployment Server(s) with Ansible</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Create an Ansible playbook (e.g., <code>provision.yml</code>) to automate the provisioning of the deployment server(s).</li>
    <li>Define a host inventory file (e.g., <code>hosts.ini</code>) containing the target server(s) for deployment.</li>
    <li>Run <code>ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini provision.yml</code> to run the Ansible playbook and provision the deployment server(s).</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>We have successfully configured the continuous delivery pipeline using configuration management tools like Ansible and Terraform. We have created a virtual machine on AWS using Terraform, and installed TeamCity and Octopus Deploy on it using Ansible. These tools will help us automate and simplify the build, test, and deployment processes for our software.</p>
  <p>Some tips or best practices for continuous delivery are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use version control for all your code and configuration files.</li>
    <li>Write automated tests for your code and run them frequently.</li>
    <li>Use code review and code quality tools to ensure code quality and consistency.</li>
    <li>Use feature flags or branch by abstraction to enable or disable features without redeploying.</li>
    <li>Monitor your pipeline performance and feedback loops.</li>
    <li>Continuously improve your pipeline based on feedback and metrics.</li>
  </ul>
