<h2>Situation:</h2>
<p>At my previous job at an e-commerce company, we had multiple data sources including SQL databases, NoSQL databases and unstructured data in the form of clickstreams, server logs, and user reviews. The data coming from these disparate sources was difficult to unify and the existing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process was unable to keep up with the growing amount of data.</p>

<h2>Task:</h2>
<p>As the DevOps engineer for the company, I was entrusted with the task of setting up a more efficient and reliable ETL pipeline. This new pipeline needed to robustly handle the volume and variety of data, provide real-time integration and analysis, maintain data quality, and allow for scalable and repeatable data delivery processes.</p>

<h2>Action:</h2>
<p>I decided to use Azure Data Factory (ADF), a cloud-based data integration service, which allows creating, scheduling, and managing data pipelines. I designed an architectural plan for our pipeline, starting with how to extract and integrate data from various sources into ADF. I implemented our business logic transformations using Data Factory's Mapping Data Flows. Once transformed, the data would be loaded into a data warehouse for analytics and visualization.</p>

<p>To maintain this infrastructure, I configured CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps which allowed for source control of the pipeline configurations and streamlined deployments.</p>

<h2>Issue/Problem:</h2>
<p>One issue we encountered was data inconsistency due to schedule delays that caused the failure of several pipeline runs. The existing alert mechanisms didn't provide enough insight into the failure causes, causing delays in diagnosis and resolution.</p>

<h2>Resolution:</h2>
<p>To mitigate and solve this problem, I used Azure Monitor along with Azure Logic Apps to create a custom and proactive alerting mechanism. Detailed logs were set up which provided granular visibility into each pipeline. In case of a pipeline failure, a Logic App would trigger an email and create a ticket into our issue tracking system with verbose error information, which drastically cut down the bottleneck of diagnosing the failure's root cause.</p>

<h2>Result:</h2>
<p>With Azure Data Factory, we managed to create a scalable and reliable ETL pipeline catering to our data integration needs. The new alert mechanism ensured timely identification and resolution of issues, making our data processes more efficient and reliable. Business teams received timely, accurate data, leading to improved decision making and insights. This project showed me how the right mix of technology and insight can significantly improve data movement and analysis in an organization.</p>
