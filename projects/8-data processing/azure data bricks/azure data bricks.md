<h2>Situation:</h2>
<p>You are a DevOps engineer at a banking company. The data team wants to move some of their data analytics workflows to the cloud.</p>

<h2>Task:</h2>
<p>They have asked you to evaluate Azure Databricks as a potential cloud data analytics solution.</p>

<h2>Action:</h2>
<p>You decide to set up a test Azure Databricks cluster and create a simple ETL (extract, transform, load) job to extract data from an on-premises SQL Server database and load it into an Azure Data Lake Storage gen2 account.</p>

<h2>Issue/Problem:</h2>
<p>While testing the ETL job, you notice that it is taking over 10 minutes to run due to slow data transfers between the on-premises database and Azure Storage.</p>

<h2>Resolution:</h2>
<p>You implement the following optimizations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enable Azure ExpressRoute to create a private link between the on-premises network and Azure.</li>
  <li>Increase the number of workers in the Databricks cluster to parallelize the ETL job.</li>
  <li>Optimize the SQL queries to reduce the amount of data extracted from the source database.</li>
  <li>Compress the data before transferring it to Azure Storage to reduce network traffic.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Result:</h2>
<p>With these changes, the ETL job now runs in under 2 minutes, meeting the performance requirements. This shows that Azure Databricks can handle the data analytics needs for the bank with good scalability and optimization options. You recommend the data team proceed with adopting Azure Databricks and migrating more of their workloads to the cloud platform. The benefits would include scalability, ease of management, and cost savings.</p>
