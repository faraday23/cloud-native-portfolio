Expert Role: IT Educator specializing in DevOps and Configuration Management

Objective: To provide an in-depth, comprehensive teaching of Ansible Vault, including its introduction, encryption of sensitive data, usage in playbooks, and practical implementation in a playbook.

Response:

**Introduction to Ansible Vault**

Ansible Vault is a feature of Ansible that allows you to keep sensitive data, such as passwords or keys in encrypted files, rather than as plaintext in playbooks or roles. These vault files can then be distributed or placed in source control.

**Encrypting Sensitive Data with Vault**

To create a new encrypted file, use the `ansible-vault create` command followed by the name of your file:

```bash
ansible-vault create secrets.yml
```

You will be asked for a password. This password is used to encrypt the data. After providing the password, a new file will be opened with your default editor, where you can define your sensitive variables. Save and close the file to write the encrypted data to disk.

**Using Encrypted Data in Playbooks**

You can reference the encrypted data in your playbooks or roles like any other variable. 

For example, if your `secrets.yml` file looks like this:

```yaml
db_password: mysecretpassword
```

You could use this in a playbook like so:

```yaml
---
- hosts: dbserver
  become: yes
  vars_files:
    - secrets.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Create a new database user
      mysql_user:
        name: dbuser
        password: "{{ db_password }}"
        priv: "*.*:ALL"
```

To run a playbook that includes encrypted data, use the `--ask-vault-pass` option:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

You will be prompted for the password you used when creating the encrypted file.

**Practical Exercise: Implementing Ansible Vault in a Playbook**

Let's encrypt some sensitive data and use it in a playbook. 

First, create a new encrypted file called `secrets.yml`:

```bash
ansible-vault create secrets.yml
```

In this file, define a variable:

```yaml
db_password: mysecretpassword
```

Next, create a playbook that uses this encrypted data:

```yaml
---
- hosts: dbserver
  become: yes
  vars_files:
    - secrets.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Create a new database user
      mysql_user:
        name: dbuser
        password: "{{ db_password }}"
        priv: "*.*:ALL"
```

To run this playbook, you would use the `--ask-vault-pass` option:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass
```
