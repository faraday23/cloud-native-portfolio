Expert Role: IT Educator specializing in DevOps and Configuration Management

Objective: To provide an in-depth, comprehensive teaching of advanced Ansible playbook techniques, including advanced playbook techniques, conditional statements in playbooks, and dealing with complex data structures.

Response:

**Advanced Playbook Techniques**

1. **Error Handling**: Ansible provides several options for handling errors during playbook execution. For instance, the `ignore_errors` directive allows a task to fail without stopping the entire playbook. Also, you can use the `failed_when` condition to define what constitutes failure.

    ```yaml
    tasks:
    - name: This will not stop the playbook
      command: /bin/false
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: This will not be considered a failure
      command: /bin/false
      failed_when: false
    ```

2. **Prompts**: You can also interactively prompt for input using the `vars_prompt` section.

    ```yaml
    vars_prompt:
    - name: "username"
      prompt: "What is your username?"
    ```

3. **Tags**: Tags allow you to run a specific part of a playbook rather than the whole playbook.

    ```yaml
    tasks:
    - name: This is a tagged task
      command: /bin/echo hello
      tags: hello
    ```

    Run the playbook with `--tags hello` to execute only the tagged task.

**Conditional Statements in Playbooks**

Ansible allows conditional execution of tasks or roles with `when` clause. This clause can include variables. Here's an example:

```yaml
tasks:
- name: "shut down CentOS 6 systems"
  command: /sbin/shutdown -t now
  when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS" and ansible_distribution_major_version == "6"
```

**Dealing with Complex Data Structures**

Ansible can handle complex data structures (like lists of hashes/dictionaries). This allows you to keep data for your hosts in structured data files (like YAML or JSON) and use that data in your playbooks.

For example, you might have a variable `users` that is a list of dictionaries:

```yaml
users:
  - name: john
    groups: ["wheel", "admin"]
  - name: jane
    groups: ["users"]
```

You can loop through this variable in a task:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Add users
    user:
      name: "{{ item.name }}"
      groups: "{{ item.groups }}"
      append: yes
    loop: "{{ users }}"
```

Possible Questions:

1. How can I skip a task in a playbook based on the output of a previous task?
2. How can I manage different environments (like development, testing, and production) with Ansible playbooks?
3. How can I deal with a situation where I need to make a configuration change only if multiple conditions are met?
4. How can I effectively use tags in a complex Ansible playbook that includes multiple roles?
5. How can I merge or filter complex data structures in Ansible?
