1. **Question: How do you design the application architecture in AWS, particularly for a containerized application?**
   *Answer*: To design the application architecture for a containerized application in AWS, we can make use of services like AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS) to handle the orchestration and workload management of our containers. In terms of defining the applications themselves, we'd want to ensure we're following a microservices architecture, thus each service is neatly encapsulated within its own container. We can then make use of something like Docker to handle the creation of our container images and manage dependencies.

2. **Question: How would you design the network infrastructure for such a deployment in AWS?**
    *Answer*: For creating a secure network environment in AWS, we would want to start by creating a VPC. Within the VPC, we can create subnets residing within different availability zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Additionally, we would use security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic and maintain security. We can also make use of private and public subnets along with NAT gateways to further ensure the security of our resources.

3. **Question: How would you set up and configure an EKS cluster?**
    *Answer*: If we were to set up an EKS cluster in AWS, we would begin by creating the EKS cluster within our designed VPC. Once the cluster is created, we would configure worker nodes that our EKS service can schedule tasks on. The configuration, including the AMI type for the worker nodes, number of nodes, node size, etc., will be largely based on the workloads we expect our applications to handle. 

4. **Question: How would you manage access to the EKS cluster?**
    *Answer*: Managing access to the EKS cluster would involve creating IAM roles and attuning them with necessary permissions. We'd use these IAM roles to allow our entities (like EC2 instances or Lambda functions) to call AWS services on our behalf. We would also leverage Kubernetes RBAC to define what actions users can take on specific resources within our cluster.

5. **Question: How would you define Kubernetes deployments?**
    *Answer*: A Kubernetes deployment is defined in a .yaml or .json file. The deployment specifies what container image to use for the pod, how many replicas of the pod to run, and values for any environmental variables. The deployment controller then ensures the specified number of pods are always up and running.  

6. **Question: What approach do you take to manage scaling and updates for your applications?**
    *Answer*: With Kubernetes, we can use the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, which scales the number of pods in a deployment or replica set based on observed CPU utilization. For updating, we would use rolling updates to progressively update pods in replica sets to ensure availability of the service during the update process.

7. **Question: What is your method of implementing load balancing and service discovery in such an environment?**
    *Answer*: Kubernetes provides an abstraction called Service for load balancing requests to pods. For external traffic, a Kubernetes Service can be exposed through AWS Elastic Load Balancer created by annotations in the service description yaml.

8. **Question: How do you approach logging and monitoring in an EKS environment?**
    *Answer*: For logging and monitoring, there are AWS services like CloudWatch and CloudTrail. You can also use open-source tools such as Fluentd for logs and Prometheus and Grafana for metrics. 

9. **Question: How do you implement CI/CD Pipelines for such deployments?**
    *Answer*: AWS provides services like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline for setting up CI/CD pipelines. Additionally, you can use third-party tools like Jenkins. A Docker image can be built and pushed to the ECR as a part of the CI process. Then, the CD pipeline would update the image of the service in the Kubernetes deployment to roll out the new version.

10. **Question: What security measures and access control mechanisms do you implement in an EKS environment?**
    *Answer*: For security, AWS provides various services like IAM for fine-grained access control to the AWS resources, Security Groups and NACLs for filtering traffic at the instance and subnet level, respectively. On the EKS side, Kubernetes RBAC controls can be used to provide fine-grained access control of the Kubernetes resources. Additionally, all the data at rest and in transit can be encrypted and regular vulnerability assessments and patching activities can be performed to eliminate any security flaws.

    - Ensure the security of the EKS cluster by regularly applying security patches and keeping up with the latest Kubernetes and EKS versions.

**Q: How does Kubernetes RBAC work and what are some of the components involved?**

**A: Kubernetes RBAC is a mechanism that allows you to control who can access what resources in your cluster. Kubernetes RBAC works as follows:**

- You define roles that specify a set of permissions to perform actions on resources, such as create, update, delete, etc. Roles can be either cluster-wide (cluster roles) or namespace-specific (roles).
- You define role bindings that assign roles to subjects, such as users, groups, or service accounts. Role bindings can be either cluster-wide (cluster role bindings) or namespace-specific (role bindings).
- When a subject tries to access a resource in the cluster, the Kubernetes API server checks if the subject has a role binding that grants them the permission to perform the action on the resource. If yes, the request is allowed; if no, the request is denied.
