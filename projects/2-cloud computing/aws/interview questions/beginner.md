8. **What is an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and how is it used in AWS?**
An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a template that contains the configuration and software information required to launch an EC2 instance. An AMI includes the following components:

- A root volume template that contains the operating system and any other software installed on the instance.
- A launch permission that specifies which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances.
- A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it is launched.

You can use an AMI to launch one or more instances of the same type and configuration. You can also create your own custom AMIs or use pre-configured AMIs provided by AWS or third-party vendors. You can share your AMIs with other AWS accounts or make them public for anyone to use.

9. **What is AWS CloudFormation and what are its benefits?**
AWS CloudFormation is a service that allows you to define and provision AWS resources using declarative templates. You can use JSON or YAML to write your templates that describe the resources and their dependencies. You can then upload your templates to AWS CloudFormation and create stacks, which are collections of resources that are created and managed as a single unit.

Some of the benefits of using AWS CloudFormation are:

- It simplifies the process of creating and managing AWS resources by automating the provisioning, updating, and deleting of resources.
- It ensures consistency and repeatability of your infrastructure by using templates that can be version controlled, validated, and reused.
- It improves security and compliance by allowing you to specify the permissions, policies, and tags for your resources.
- It enables collaboration and sharing by allowing you to use nested stacks, cross-stack references, modules, and registry to organize and reuse your templates.
- It supports customization and extensibility by allowing you to use parameters, mappings, conditions, outputs, functions, macros, transforms, and custom resources to tailor your templates to your needs.

10. **What is AWS Lambda and what are its use cases?**
AWS Lambda is a service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can write your code in any of the supported languages (such as Python, Node.js, Java, Go, etc.) and upload it to AWS Lambda as a function. You can then configure your function to be triggered by various events from other AWS services (such as S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, etc.) or external sources (such as HTTP requests, IoT devices, etc.). You only pay for the compute time you consume when your function is executed.

Some of the use cases of AWS Lambda are:

- Data processing: You can use AWS Lambda to process data from various sources such as streams (using Amazon Kinesis or Amazon MSK), queues (using Amazon SQS), databases (using Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon RDS), or files (using Amazon S3).
- Web applications: You can use AWS Lambda to create serverless web applications that handle user requests via API Gateway or Application Load Balancer. You can also use AWS Lambda to perform backend tasks such as authentication, authorization, validation, etc.
- Mobile applications: You can use AWS Lambda to create serverless mobile applications that interact with users via Amazon Cognito or Amazon Pinpoint. You can also use AWS Lambda to perform backend tasks such as push notifications, image processing, geolocation, etc.
- IoT applications: You can use AWS Lambda to create serverless IoT applications that communicate with devices via AWS IoT Core or AWS IoT Greengrass. You can also use AWS Lambda to perform backend tasks such as device management, data analysis, machine learning, etc.
- Chatbots: You can use AWS Lambda to create serverless chatbots that converse with users via Amazon Lex or Amazon Connect. You can also use AWS Lambda to perform backend tasks such as natural language processing, sentiment analysis, business logic, etc.
