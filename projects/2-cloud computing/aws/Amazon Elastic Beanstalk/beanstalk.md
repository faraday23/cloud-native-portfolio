<b>Situation:</b>
<p>
At my previous company, we had developed a web application that was initially hosted on a few standalone Amazon EC2 instances. As the user base grew and we started releasing features more frequently, deployments became cumbersome. There was no clear scaling strategy, and manual deployments were error-prone, causing frequent downtimes.
</p>

<b>Task:</b>
<p>
I was assigned the responsibility of streamlining the deployment process, ensuring high availability, and setting up auto-scaling to handle varying loads on our application.
</p>

<b>Action:</b>
<p>
Given the requirements and the nature of our application, I identified Amazon Elastic Beanstalk as an ideal solution because of its simplicity in managing and deploying web applications. Here's what I did:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Created a new Elastic Beanstalk environment tailored for our application (e.g., a Python/Django web app).</li>
    <li>Configured environment variables, database connections, and other necessary resources in the Elastic Beanstalk environment.</li>
    <li>Migrated our database to RDS to ensure it was scalable and backups were maintained.</li>
    <li>Modified our codebase to work seamlessly with Elastic Beanstalk and integrated it with AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD.</li>
    <li>Set up auto-scaling rules and health checks to ensure our application scaled as required and remained healthy.</li>
</ol>

<b>Issue:</b>
<p>
After migrating, we observed that during peak traffic times, the database connections were getting exhausted, leading to application timeouts. It was puzzling because the auto-scaling of the application instances was working perfectly, but the bottleneck seemed to be at the database level.
</p>

<b>Resolution:</b>
<p>
To address this:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>I reviewed the RDS configuration and noticed that the max connections setting was set too low for our use-case.</li>
    <li>Adjusted the RDS instance type and tweaked the max connections parameter to better suit our application's needs.</li>
    <li>Implemented connection pooling at the application layer to further optimize the use of database connections and reduce overhead.</li>
</ol>

<b>Result:</b>
<p>
Post these changes:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The application became highly available with zero downtime during deployments.</li>
    <li>Auto-scaling ensured that we could handle peak loads without manual intervention.</li>
    <li>The streamlined CI/CD process reduced the deployment time from hours to minutes.</li>
    <li>Connection pooling and database optimizations eradicated the timeout issues, offering our users a smooth and uninterrupted experience.</li>
    <li>Overall, the team was able to deploy more frequently, confidently, and respond more quickly to the demands of our growing user base.</li>
</ol>
