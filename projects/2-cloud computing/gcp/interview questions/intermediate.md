1. **Question**: Can you explain the structure of GCP's resource hierarchy?
**Answer**: At the broadest level, GCP's resource hierarchy begins with the organization, which is the supreme level in the hierarchy. Below that, you have folders that help segment the organization into subdomains. The third tier is the projects, which serve as an isolation boundary. Finally, under projects, you have resources like App Engine instances, Cloud Functions, and more.

2. **Question**: What is the purpose and usage of the Cloud Composer in GCP?
**Answer**: Cloud Composer is a fully managed workflow orchestration service built on Apache Airflow. It allows for pipeline creation, scheduling, and monitoring, with easy-to-build python scripts. It enables visualizations which makes monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing pipelines easier. It's commonly used for automated ETL jobs, real-time analytics, and data import/export.

3. **Question**: How do you maximize the use of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)? 
**Answer**: For maximum utilization of GKE, consider implementing auto-scaling, efficient resource management, and robust monitoring. Auto-scaling can adjust the number of nodes based on demand, lowering costs. Efficient resource management involves properly defining resource requirements. Container-native monitoring with Cloud Monitoring helps in tracking deployment.

4. **Question**: What would you use Cloud Pub/Sub for in Google Cloud Platform?
**Answer**: Cloud Pub/Sub is a messaging service that allows for real-time and reliable messaging between independent applications. It's used for event-driven computing, creating decoupled systems, analytics pipelines, and integrating with external systems. It enables asynchronous communication, reducing system dependencies and increasing reliability.

5. **Question**: Explain the functionality of Google Cloud's operations suite (formerly Stackdriver).
**Answer**: Google Cloud's operations suite is a hybrid tool offering integrated monitoring, logging and diagnostics. The Operations suite allows users to debug applications, monitor the health of cloud infrastructure, and is a source of valuable insights to optimize costs through detailed traces and logs.

6. **Question**: Can you describe the difference between Google Cloud Storage and Google Cloud SQL?
**Answer**: Google Cloud Storage is a RESTful online storage web service for storing and accessing data on Google Cloud platform infrastructure. It is ideal for object and archival storage.

7. **Question**: What is Google Cloud IAM and what does it offer?
**Answer**: IAM, or Identity and Access Management, is a suite of tools provided by Google Cloud to help administrators authorize who can take action on specific resources. IAM provides the right access to the right people, reducing the risk of access-denied errors. It lends flexibility and control over cloud resources by creating custom roles.

8. **Question**: What's a load balancer in GCP, and when would you use it?
**Answer**: GCP Load Balancing is a fully distributed, software-defined, managed service for all types of workloads. It allows you to automatically scale your applications and distribute network traffic to ensure optimal performance. It can manage HTTP(S), TCP/SSL, and UDP workloads, globally or regionally. It's most effective when you need to distribute network traffic among resources dynamically (auto-scaling) or across regions.

9. **Question**: Can you describe Google Dataflow and how is it used within Google Cloud?
**Answer**: Google Dataflow is a fully managed streaming analytics service that minimizes latency, processing time, and cost through autoscaling and batch processing. With its Apache Beam SDK, you can create complex, large-scale data processing tasks as pipelines to be run on the Dataflow service. It's often used for real-time analysis, ETL processes, and predicting trends.

10. **Question**: How does Google Cloud’s Firestore work and what are its benefits?
**Answer**: Firestore is a NoSQL document database for storing, syncing, and querying data for serverless, mobile, and web apps. Firestore provides live synchronization, offline support, and ACID transactions across hundreds of documents and collections. Its benefits include robust client libraries, real-time updates, automatic multi-region data replication, and strong consistency, making it great for multi-user collaborative applications.
