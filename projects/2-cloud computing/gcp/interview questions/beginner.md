Sure, here are some beginner-level Google Cloud Platform interview questions along with sample answers:

**1. What is Google Cloud Platform and why would a business choose to use it?**

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google that includes data storage, data analytics, and machine learning services among many others. Businesses might choose it due to its strong integration with other Google services, the quality of its analytics and machine learning capabilities, or pricing, which often charges less for internal network traffic compared to other popular providers.

**2. Can you explain the difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS in the context of GCP?**

IaaS, or Infrastructure as a Service, provides automated, scalable compute resources over the internet. In the GCP context, Google Compute Engine is an example of an IaaS.

PaaS, or Platform as a Service, provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of maintaining the infrastructure. Google App Engine is an example of a PaaS in GCP.

SaaS, or Software as a Service, provides a complete software solution which users can pay for on a subscription basis. Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) is an example of SaaS.

**3. What is the role of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)?**

GKE is a managed service from Google Cloud to run Docker containers. Itâ€™s a Kubernetes platform that takes care of the orchestration, scaling and maintenance of your containerized applications across multiple machines.

**4. What is the difference between a snapshot and an image in GCP?**

An image is a template that contains an operating system, while a snapshot is a copy of disk's data at a given point in time. A snapshot can be used to create a boot disk that can start an instance. Conversely, an image in GCP can be used to create a boot disk for an instance or to create a machine image of an instance.

**5. Can you explain what Cloud SQL is and why you might use it?**

Cloud SQL is a fully-managed database service that helps to set up, maintain, manage, and administer relational MySQL and PostgreSQL databases in the cloud. You might use it if you want to leverage the capabilities of a relational SQL database without the overhead of managing the database infrastructure and related tasks.

**6. What is the importance of VPC in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)?**

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) provides a secure, private network for your Google Cloud resources, giving you control over your network settings, such as IP address ranges, subnets, etc., enhancing the security for your resources.

**7. Explain the uses of Google Cloud Functions.**

Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment, which allows you to build and deploy applications and services without having to manage and provision servers. It can be used for creating APIs, responding to Cloud Storage changes, processing tasks in the background, and handling real-time file uploads.

**8. What is Firestore, and how is it different from other databases on Google Cloud?**

Firestore is a NoSQL document database that is part of the Firebase platform but available independently as well. Unlike traditional relational databases, Firestore stores data in a flexible, scalable format with data organized into collections of documents. Its main difference from other databases is its tight integration with Firebase's real-time capabilities and client SDKs.

**9. What does Google Cloud Storage provide and how can you secure this data?**

Google Cloud Storage provides scalable and durable storage for your data across four unique storage classes: Standard, Nearline, Coldline, and Archive for varying use cases and access requirements. Data can be secured using Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, Access Control Lists (ACLs) and encryption keys for server-side encryption.

**10. How can you ensure cost optimization in GCP?**

Cost optimization can be achieved in several ways: using committed use contracts for predictable workloads, selecting the right machine type matching the workload profile, using preemptible VM instances for batch workloads, keeping an eye on cloud storage costs, and using the cost management tools provided by Google to visualize, understand, and manage costs. You should also consider using discounts offered by GCP, like sustained use discounts and rightsizing recommendations.
