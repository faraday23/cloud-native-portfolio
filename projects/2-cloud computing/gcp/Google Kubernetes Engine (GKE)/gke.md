<h2><b>Situation:</b></h2>
<p>
At a previous e-commerce company I worked for, we had several microservices that powered various facets of our platform, from inventory management to user authentication. These services were initially deployed on individual virtual machines in Google Compute Engine. However, as our platform grew in complexity and traffic, managing and scaling these VMs became a bottleneck.
</p>

<h2><b>Task:</b></h2>
<p>
I was entrusted with the responsibility to devise a strategy that would make our infrastructure more scalable, manageable, and resilient, all while ensuring cost-effectiveness.
</p>

<h2><b>Action:</b></h2>
<p>
Given the microservices architecture of our application and the benefits of containerization, I identified Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as the ideal solution. My approach was as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Containerized each microservice using Docker, ensuring that they were stateless and could be easily scaled.</li>
    <li>Set up a GKE cluster, taking into consideration our current and projected workloads.</li>
    <li>Deployed each microservice on GKE using Kubernetes Deployments and Services.</li>
    <li>Configured Helm to manage package deployments and simplify the release management.</li>
    <li>Implemented GKE's autoscaling features to automatically scale our pods and nodes based on traffic and resource usage.</li>
</ol>

<h2><b>Issue:</b></h2>
<p>
After transitioning to GKE, we observed that while our services scaled seamlessly, our database, which was external to the cluster, became a bottleneck during traffic surges, leading to increased latencies.
</p>

<h2><b>Resolution:</b></h2>
<p>
To tackle this challenge:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>I evaluated using Google Cloud SQL with its high availability and failover capabilities.</li>
    <li>Migrated our database to Cloud SQL, ensuring data consistency and minimal downtime during the transition.</li>
    <li>Configured connection pooling at the application layer to optimize the use of database connections and reduce overhead.</li>
    <li>Set up monitoring and alerts using Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging to keep an eye on database performance metrics and proactively address potential issues.</li>
</ol>

<h2><b>Result:</b></h2>
<p>
After the changes:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Our microservices infrastructure became highly scalable and resilient, adjusting seamlessly to varying loads.</li>
    <li>Deployment and rollback processes were streamlined, reducing the time and complexity of releases.</li>
    <li>The database performance issues were mitigated, offering a smoother user experience even during peak traffic times.</li>
    <li>The total cost of ownership reduced due to efficient resource utilization and the elimination of manual management overhead.</li>
    <li>The team was empowered to focus more on feature development, leading to quicker product iterations and a more responsive platform.</li>
</ol>
