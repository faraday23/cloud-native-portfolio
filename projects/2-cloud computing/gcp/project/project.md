**Expert Role: Cloud Solutions Architect**

**Objective:** Provide guidance on architecting a cloud-native solution using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services including App Engine, Kubernetes (Helm/Tiller), Cloud Functions, Firebase, IAM, and Load Balancers.

**Solution:**

To architect a cloud-native solution using GCP services, follow these steps:

1. **Define Application Requirements:**
   - Identify the application components and services required, considering factors such as scalability, fault tolerance, and performance.
   - Determine the appropriate GCP services to fulfill the application requirements.

2. **App Engine for Managed Serverless Applications:**
   - Utilize Google App Engine to deploy and manage serverless applications.
   - Configure App Engine to automatically scale based on traffic, providing an easy and scalable platform for your application.

3. **Kubernetes with Helm/Tiller for Containerized Applications:**
   - Deploy containerized applications using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
   - Utilize Helm and Tiller to simplify the deployment and management of Kubernetes applications, allowing for easy package management and version control.

4. **Serverless Compute with Cloud Functions:**
   - Leverage Cloud Functions to run event-driven, serverless compute in response to events or HTTP triggers.
   - Use Cloud Functions for lightweight, serverless components or microservices within your architecture.

5. **Real-time Data and User Management with Firebase:**
   - Integrate Firebase into your solution to handle real-time data synchronization, user authentication, and messaging services.
   - Utilize Firebase Authentication, Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, and Firebase Cloud Messaging for seamless user experiences.

6. **IAM for Access Control and Security:**
   - Define and implement IAM roles and permissions to control access to GCP resources and services.
   - Utilize IAM to enforce the principle of least privilege and ensure secure access management.

7. **Load Balancing for Scalability and High Availability:**
   - Utilize GCP Load Balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances or regions, ensuring high availability and scalability.
   - Choose between HTTP(S) Load Balancing, Network Load Balancing, or Internal Load Balancing based on your application's specific requirements.

**Result:**
By following these steps, you will architect a cloud-native solution using GCP services such as App Engine, Kubernetes (Helm/Tiller), Cloud Functions, Firebase, IAM, and Load Balancers. This solution provides scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of management for your cloud-native applications.

**Possible Questions:**
1. How can you set up automatic scaling in App Engine based on incoming traffic?
2. Can you explain the role of Helm and Tiller in managing Kubernetes deployments?
3. What are some best practices for implementing authentication and authorization using Firebase Authentication and IAM?
4. How can you ensure high availability and fault tolerance in Load Balancers on GCP?
5. Can you explain how to secure communication between services deployed in GKE using IAM roles and service accounts?
