OpenStack is an open source cloud computing platform that provides infrastructure as a service to deploy and manage cloud workloads. It supports:

- Compute (Nova): Creates and manages virtual machines
- Imaging (Glance): Stores and deploys virtual machine disk images
- Storage (Cinder): Provides block storage to VMs  
- Networking (Neutron): Provides virtual network functionality
- Identity (Keystone): Provides authentication and access control

2. What are the core components of OpenStack?

The core components of OpenStack are:

- Compute (Nova): Manages the lifecycle of virtual machines.
- Image (Glance): Stores and retrieves virtual machine disk images. 
- Block Storage (Cinder): Provides persistent block level storage.  
- Networking (Neutron): Providers network connectivity and IP addresses. 
- Identity (Keystone): Provides authentication and authorization services.
- Dashboard (Horizon): Provides graphical dashboard interface for managing OpenStack.

3. What are OpenStack services?

OpenStack services provide the basic functionality of the platform. Main services are:

- Compute node: Runs Nova compute service to host virtual machines. 
- Network node: Runs Neutron network service for network connectivity.
- Block storage node: Runs Cinder storage service for block storage.
- Object storage node: Runs Swift storage service for object storage.

Nodes communicate using RESTful APIs over HTTP.

5. What are OpenStack flavors?

OpenStack flavors define different combinations of RAM, vCPUs and disk size for instances. They:

- Provide templates for launching VM instances 
- Are defined during OpenStack installation  
- Determine types of VM instances that can be launched
- Are mapped to specific hardware configurations
- Have names like m1.small, m1.medium, etc.  
- Can be defined and edited as needed.

Flavors allow launching different types of instances as per workload requirements.

Sure, I can help you with that. Here are 10 possible openstack interview questions along with sample answers for a devops position interview:

1. **What is OpenStack?**
OpenStack is an open-source platform that uses virtual resources to create and manage private and public clouds. The tools that come under the OpenStack platform are known as "projects,". These projects offer different functionality for seamlessly handling the core cloud-computing services, such as computing, networking, storage, identity, and image services. We can combine several projects to create a unique deployable cloud for ease and seamless working[^1^][2].

2. **What are the basic functions of Identity Service in OpenStack?**
Identity Service (also known as Keystone) is the project that provides authentication and authorization services for OpenStack. It also manages the service catalog, which contains information about the available services and their endpoints. Identity Service supports multiple identity backends, such as SQL database, LDAP, or external identity providers. It also supports multiple authentication methods, such as password, token, or federated credentials[^2^][1].

3. **What are the two types of storage does OpenStack Compute provides?**
OpenStack Compute (also known as Nova) provides two types of storage: ephemeral storage and persistent storage. Ephemeral storage is the temporary local storage that is attached to a virtual machine instance. It is deleted when the instance is terminated or rebuilt. Persistent storage is the durable external storage that can be attached or detached from a virtual machine instance. It persists independently of the instance lifecycle and can be reused or migrated between instances[^2^][1].

4. **What is a hypervisor and what types are supported by OpenStack?**
A hypervisor is a software layer that enables virtualization of physical resources, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network. It creates and manages virtual machines (VMs) that run on top of the physical hardware. OpenStack supports various types of hypervisors, such as KVM, Xen, VMware ESXi, Hyper-V, LXC, QEMU, and UML[^2^][1].

5. **What are the components of bare-metal nodes in OpenStack?**
Bare-metal nodes are physical servers that can be provisioned and managed by OpenStack without using any hypervisor layer. They are useful for running workloads that require direct access to hardware resources or high performance. The components of bare-metal nodes in OpenStack are[^1^][2]:

- Ironic: The project that provides bare-metal provisioning and management services for OpenStack. It interacts with various drivers to control the power and boot states of bare-metal nodes.
- Neutron: The project that provides networking services for OpenStack. It supports various network plugins and drivers to enable connectivity and security for bare-metal nodes.
- Glance: The project that provides image services for OpenStack. It stores and delivers images that can be used to boot bare-metal nodes.
- Swift: The project that provides object storage services for OpenStack. It stores and serves large files, such as images or backups, that can be accessed by bare-metal nodes.
- Cinder: The project that provides block storage services for OpenStack. It enables attaching and detaching persistent volumes to bare-metal nodes.

6. **How do you troubleshoot a slow website using OpenStack?**
One possible approach to troubleshoot a slow website using OpenStack is[^1^][2]:

- Use the APM service map to identify which service or endpoint is causing the slowdown.
- Drill down into the service or endpoint dashboard to see the traces and spans of the requests.
- Look for any errors, high latency, or resource contention in the tracesSure, I can continue with more questions and answers. Here are some more openstack interview questions along with sample answers for a devops position interview:

7. **What is the difference between Nova and Cinder?**
Nova and Cinder are two projects that provide different types of storage services for OpenStack. Nova provides ephemeral storage, which is the temporary local storage that is attached to a virtual machine instance. Cinder provides persistent storage, which is the durable external storage that can be attached or detached from a virtual machine instance.

8. **What is the function of the user CRUD in OpenStack?**
The user CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is the function that allows managing users in OpenStack. It is provided by the Identity Service (Keystone) project. The user CRUD can be performed using various methods, such as CLI commands, REST API calls, or web dashboard.

9. **What are the benefits of using OpenStack orchestration service?**
OpenStack orchestration service (also known as Heat) is the project that provides a template-based engine to automate the creation and management of complex cloud applications. Some of the benefits of using OpenStack orchestration service are:

- It simplifies the deployment and configuration of multiple resources and services in a consistent and repeatable manner.
- It enables scaling up or down the cloud applications based on predefined policies or triggers.
- It supports various template formats, such as HOT (Heat Orchestration Template) or AWS CloudFormation.
- It integrates with other OpenStack projects, such as Nova, Neutron, Cinder, Swift, etc.

10. **How do you manage shares in OpenStack?**
Shares are the file-based storage resources that can be created and managed by OpenStack shared file systems service (also known as Manila). Shares can be accessed by multiple instances using protocols such as NFS or CIFS. To manage shares in OpenStack, you can use various methods, such as CLI commands, REST API calls, or web dashboard. Some of the common operations to manage shares are:

- Create a share type: A share type defines the characteristics and capabilities of a share, such as size, protocol, driver options, etc. You can create a share type using the command `manila type-create <name> <is_public>`.
- Create a share: A share is an instance of a share type that can be allocated from a share network. You can create a share using the command `manila create <share_type> <size> --name <name> --share-network <share_network>`.
- List shares: You can list all the shares that you have access to using the command `manila list`.
- Delete a share: You can delete a share that you no longer need using the command `manila delete <share>`.
