    <h1>Situation</h1>
    <p>
      I was part of a cloud engineering team in a company that offers an e-commerce platform. The application was initially monolithic and hosted on on-premises servers, and as the user base grew, performance began to degrade due to the inherent scalability limitations of our monolithic architecture.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Task</h1>
    <p>
      Our goal was to eliminate the performance bottlenecks and enable smoother scalability by transitioning to a microservices architecture. We selected OpenStack to host our services due to its comprehensive suite of tools and its open-source nature that offered us customization flexibility.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Action</h1>
    <p>
      We started by breaking down the monolithic application into multiple microservices and containerizing each with Docker. We then used OpenStack's Magnum to set up a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster for our containerized applications. For user authentication, we used OpenStack's Keystone which served as our identity service.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To create a secure network for our services, we used OpenStack Neutron. Using Neutron, we created private networks, attached security group rules, and established network policies.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Next, to balance traffic, we integrated our services with the Octavia load balancing service. Our databases were managed using Trove, which gave us the means to handle large scale data with high availability.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For monitoring our services effectively, we used Ceilometer for detailed insight into our application's performance. Also, all Docker images created for our microservices were stored and managed using OpenStack Swift.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Finally, we created a CI/CD pipeline using Zuul to facilitate continuous development, integration, and deployment, ensuring our team could rapidly iterate and deploy changes to production.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Issue/Problem</h1>
    <p>
      During the process, we faced a significant problem. Some services were not communicating properly with each other, resulting in intermittent application failures.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Resolution</h1>
    <p>
      To resolve this, I first reviewed the Neutron network policies and found some misconfigurations that were blocking necessary traffic between services. After rectifying the network policies and security rules, interservice communication was restored, and the application started functioning correctly.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Result</h1>
    <p>
      Post migration, our application could easily scale based on demand and was more resilient due to the innate fault tolerance of the microservice architecture. Development became more agile as each microservice could be developed and deployed independently. This led to a superior customer experience, with shorter response times and less downtime even during peak traffic periods.
