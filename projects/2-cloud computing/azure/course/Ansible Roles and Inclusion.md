Expert Role: IT Educator specializing in DevOps and Configuration Management

Objective: To provide an in-depth, comprehensive teaching of Ansible roles, role directory structure, their creation and usage, task inclusion and practical exercise on creating and using a role in a playbook.

Response:

**Overview of Ansible Roles**

Ansible roles provide a framework for fully independent, or interdependent collections of variables, tasks, files, templates, and modules. In simple terms, roles group tasks and allow you to break your playbook into reusable components.

Each role is basically limited to a particular functionality or desired output, with all the necessary steps to provide that result either within the same role itself or in other roles listed as dependencies.

**Role Directory Structure**

Roles are a way to group multiple tasks into one container to do the automation in very effective manner. The directory structure of a role would look like this:

```
role_name/
    defaults/
        main.yml
    files/
    handlers/
        main.yml
    meta/
        main.yml
    tasks/
        main.yml
    templates/
    vars/
        main.yml
```

**Creating and Using Roles**

Let's create a simple role that installs and starts the Apache web server. First, create the role directory structure using `ansible-galaxy`:

```bash
ansible-galaxy init apache
```

Next, edit `apache/tasks/main.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Install Apache
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present

- name: Start Apache
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: started
```

To use the role in a playbook:

```yaml
---
- hosts: webserver
  become: yes

  roles:
    - apache
```

**Ansible Task Inclusion**

Tasks can be included in a playbook from other files using the `include_tasks` directive. For example:

```yaml
---
- hosts: webserver
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - include_tasks: install.yml
```

In this example, all the tasks defined in `install.yml` will be included at this point in the playbook.

**Practical Exercise: Creating and Using a Role in a Playbook**

Now let's create a playbook that uses multiple roles. We'll create two roles: one for installing and starting Apache (`apache`) and another for installing PHP (`php`). 

```bash
ansible-galaxy init apache
ansible-galaxy init php
```

Edit `apache/tasks/main.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Install Apache
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present

- name: Start Apache
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: started
```

Edit `php/tasks/main.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Install PHP
  apt:
    name: php
    state: present
```

To use the roles in a playbook:

```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  roles:
    - apache
    - php
```

This playbook will install and start Apache, then install PHP on all the hosts in the `webservers` group.

Possible Questions:

1. How can I conditionally include a task or a role in Ansible?
2. How can I include variables in a role?
3. How can I override default role variables?
4. Can I include a task or a role multiple times in a playbook?
5. What are the best practices for organizing Ansible roles and tasks for a complex project?
