<h2><b>Situation:</b></h2>
<p>
At my previous role in a healthcare tech company, we developed a web application that physicians used to monitor patient data and provide remote consultations. Initially, the application was hosted on on-premises servers. However, as our user base grew, we faced challenges in terms of scalability, deployment speed, and integrating with other Azure services for analytics and AI capabilities.
</p>

<h2><b>Task:</b></h2>
<p>
I was charged with the responsibility of migrating our application to the cloud to leverage scalability, integrate with Azure's suite of tools, and streamline our deployment processes.
</p>

<h2><b>Action:</b></h2>
<p>
Given the nature of our web application and the Azure-centric tools we wanted to leverage, I zeroed in on Azure App Services as the optimal choice. My approach included:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Containerizing our application to ensure a smooth transition and deployment to Azure.</li>
    <li>Setting up an Azure App Service Plan tailored to our expected workloads.</li>
    <li>Migrating our application to Azure App Services, ensuring all dependencies and configurations were correctly set.</li>
    <li>Integrating Azure DevOps for CI/CD, allowing automated builds and deployments to App Services.</li>
    <li>Setting up auto-scaling and custom domain configurations within the App Service.</li>
</ol>

<h2><b>Issue:</b></h2>
<p>
While the migration to Azure App Services provided scalability and improved deployment processes, we noticed a latency issue for users accessing the application from distant regions. This latency hampered the real-time data monitoring capabilities of our application.
</p>

<h2><b>Resolution:</b></h2>
<p>
To address the latency concerns:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>I implemented Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache static assets closer to our global users.</li>
    <li>Set up Azure Traffic Manager to distribute incoming requests to the nearest data center, reducing latency.</li>
    <li>Migrated our database to Azure Cosmos DB, which provided multi-region replication, ensuring data was available close to where users accessed the application.</li>
    <li>Continuously monitored performance metrics using Azure Monitor and Application Insights to proactively identify and address potential bottlenecks.</li>
</ol>

<h2><b>Result:</b></h2>
<p>
Post these implementations:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The application's responsiveness improved significantly for users across the globe.</li>
    <li>We benefited from seamless scalability, which Azure App Services provided, ensuring high availability even during peak usage times.</li>
    <li>The CI/CD integration reduced our deployment times from hours to minutes, facilitating quicker feature releases.</li>
    <li>Integration with Azure services (like AI and analytics tools) became straightforward, leading to enhanced application capabilities.</li>
    <li>Overall, our physicians and medical staff had a more reliable and efficient tool, leading to better patient care and improved outcomes.</li>
</ol>
