**Ansible Error Handling Mechanics**

Ansible has built-in mechanisms for error handling. You can control how Ansible responds to errors at both the block and task level. 

At the task level, you can use the `ignore_errors` directive to specify that Ansible should ignore any errors from that task and continue with the rest of the playbook. For example:

```yaml
- name: This will not stop the playbook
  command: /bin/false
  ignore_errors: yes
```

At the block level, you can group several tasks together and apply error handling to all of them at once. If any task within the block fails, Ansible will execute the block's `rescue` section. If the block runs successfully, Ansible can run the `always` section, regardless of whether an error occurred. 

Here's an example:

```yaml
block:
- name: This will fail
  command: /bin/false

rescue:
- name: This will be executed if a failure occurs
  command: echo "An error occurred"

always:
- name: This is executed regardless of errors
  command: echo "This always runs"
```

**Best Practices for Error Handling in Ansible**

1. **Use `failed_when` to define failure conditions**: By default, Ansible considers a task failed if the underlying command returns a non-zero exit status. But you can also define custom failure conditions with the `failed_when` directive. For example, you might consider a shell command failed if it produces certain output, even if it exits with a status of 0.

2. **Use `ignore_errors` judiciously**: While `ignore_errors` can be helpful, it's best used sparingly. Ignoring errors can lead to playbooks that appear to work fine when they're actually failing. Instead of ignoring errors, consider using `failed_when` to define exactly what constitutes a failure for that task.

3. **Use blocks for error handling over multiple tasks**: Blocks help you manage errors over several tasks, ensuring that if anything in the block fails, you can run a set of recovery tasks.

4. **Use handlers for clean-up tasks**: You can use handlers to run tasks that clean up after an error. This can be especially useful in ensuring that any resources provisioned during a failed playbook run are correctly cleaned up.

**Practical Exercise: Implementing Error Handling in a Playbook**

Here's an example playbook that includes some of these error handling techniques:

```yaml
---
- name: Handle errors
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:
    - name: This may fail
      command: /bin/false
      register: result
      failed_when: "'FAILED' in result.stdout"
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: This block may fail
      block:
        - name: This will fail
          command: /bin/false
      rescue:
        - name: Do something if a failure occurs
          command: echo "An error occurred"
      always:
        - name: Do this regardless of errors
          command: echo "This always runs"
...
```

This playbook shows an individual task that might fail, but the playbook will continue because `ignore_errors: yes` is set. The playbook also shows a block of tasks that might fail. If an error occurs, the `rescue` section is run. Regardless of whether an error occurs, the `always` section is run.
