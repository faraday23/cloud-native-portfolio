Objective: To provide an in-depth, comprehensive teaching of Ansible testing, debugging techniques, and best practices for troubleshooting Ansible.

Response:

**Testing Ansible Playbooks**

Testing your playbooks is crucial to ensure that your configurations are being applied as expected. Here are some methods for testing Ansible playbooks:

1. **Dry Run (Check Mode)**: Ansible provides a "dry run" mode that executes a playbook without making actual changes on the target hosts. This is enabled using the `--check` option.

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check
    ```

2. **Syntax Check**: Ansible can check a playbook for syntax errors with the `--syntax-check` option.

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook playbook.yml --syntax-check
    ```

3. **Unit Testing with Molecule**: Molecule is a testing framework for Ansible that helps you write test cases for your Ansible roles.

**Ansible Debugging Techniques**

Debugging is key to solving problems when your playbooks are not behaving as expected. Here are some debugging techniques:

1. **Verbose Mode**: Ansible offers verbose modes which provide more details about what the playbook is doing. The `-v` (verbose) flag can be used up to four times to increase the verbosity.

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook playbook.yml -vvv
    ```

2. **Debug Module**: Ansible's debug module can be used to print messages or variables to stdout. 

    ```yaml
    tasks:
      - name: Display a variable
        debug:
          var: my_variable
    ```

3. **Error Handling**: As mentioned in the previous section, error handling directives like `ignore_errors` and `failed_when` can also be used for debugging by forcing tasks to fail.

**Best Practices for Troubleshooting Ansible**

1. **Check Your Work**: This may sound obvious, but typos and syntax errors are a common cause of issues in Ansible playbooks. Always double-check your work.

2. **Understand Your Modules**: Understanding the modules you're using is key to using them correctly and interpreting their output. Take the time to read the documentation for the modules you're using.

3. **Use Version Control**: Using a version control system like Git allows you to keep track of changes, making it easier to find when a problem was introduced.

4. **Start Simple, Then Expand**: If you're having trouble with a playbook, try simplifying it down to a minimum viable playbook and then gradually add complexity.

Possible Questions:

1. How can I simulate a playbook run on a subset of my inventory?
2. How can I print all variables for a host or group?
3. What are some common issues when using check mode and how can I avoid them?
4. How can I debug a module that is not behaving as expected?
5. How can I use version control to help debug issues with my playbooks?
