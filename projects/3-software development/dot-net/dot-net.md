<h1>Migrating to Cloud-Native Architecture: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

<h2>1. Analyzing the Existing Application</h2>
<p>During this stage, you'd look at the current monolithic application and identify distinct areas of functionality that can be separated into independent microservices.</p>

<h2>2. Creating Microservices in .NET</h2>
<p>You can use Visual Studio to create new .NET projects for each microservice. With the minimal APIs feature introduced in .NET 6, you can quickly define lightweight, expressive HTTP APIs. Here's an example:</p>
<pre>
<code>
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello, world!");

app.Run();
</code>
</pre>

<h2>3. Containerizing Microservices</h2>
<p>The .NET SDK has built-in support for Docker. In the project directory, you can add a <code>Dockerfile</code> to define how to build a Docker image of your microservice:</p>
<pre>
<code>
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["MyMicroservice.csproj", "./"]
RUN dotnet restore "./MyMicroservice.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/."
RUN dotnet build "MyMicroservice.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "MyMicroservice.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyMicroservice.dll"]
</code>
</pre>

<h2>4. Deploying to Azure</h2>
<p>You can deploy your Docker containers to Azure using Azure Container Instances (ACI) or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell can be used for deployment.</p>

<h2>5. Using Azure Services</h2>
<p>You can use various Azure services as the backing services for your application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Azure SQL Database or Azure Cosmos DB for data storage.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Azure Service Bus for message passing between microservices.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Azure Cache for Redis for caching.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Azure Application Insights for monitoring and diagnostics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Ensuring Consistency Across Microservices</h2>
<p>To ensure consistency and reliability across microservices, you implemented the saga pattern using Azure Service Bus and Azure Durable Functions. Here's an example of how you might define a durable function to coordinate a saga:</p>
<pre>
<code>
[FunctionName("SagaOrchestrator")]
public static async Task RunOrchestrator(
    [OrchestrationTrigger] IDurableOrchestrationContext context)
{
    var transactionData = context.GetInput&lt;TransactionData&gt;();

    try
    {
        await context.CallActivityAsync("PerformStep1", transactionData);
        await context.CallActivityAsync("PerformStep2", transactionData);
        // Additional steps...
    }
    catch (Exception)
    {
        // Compensate for any completed transactions
        await context.CallActivityAsync("CompensateStep1", transactionData);
        await context.CallActivityAsync("CompensateStep2", transactionData);
        // Additional compensations...
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

<h2>7. Results and Feedback</h2>
<p>After successfully migrating the application to a cloud-native architecture using .NET and Azure, you received positive feedback from your manager and clients for your work. This is a testament to the benefits of using cloud-native architectures and the capabilities of .NET and Azure.</p>
