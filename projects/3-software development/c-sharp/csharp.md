<h1>Migrating to Cloud-Native Architecture: My Journey</h1>

<h3>Step 1: Analyzing the Existing Application</h3>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> I aimed to identify the bounded contexts and domains that could be separated into independent microservices.</p>
<ol>
    <li>I reviewed the existing codebase to understand its architecture.</li>
    <li>I identified components that could function as independent microservices.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 2: Creating a Solution Using Visual Studio and C#</h3>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> My objective was to create a solution with several projects for each microservice.</p>
<ol>
    <li>I opened Visual Studio.</li>
    <li>I created a new solution for the microservices.</li>
    <li>I added a project for each microservice.</li>
</ol>
<pre>
// Here's an example of a simple microservice I created in ASP.NET Core
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllers();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => endpoints.MapControllers());
    }
}
</pre>

<h3>Step 3: Utilizing Docker for Containerization</h3>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> I aimed to containerize each microservice using Docker.</p>
<ol>
    <li>I created a Dockerfile for each microservice.</li>
</ol>
<pre>
# Here's an example Dockerfile I used
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["MyMicroservice/MyMicroservice.csproj", "MyMicroservice/"]
RUN dotnet restore "MyMicroservice/MyMicroservice.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/MyMicroservice"
RUN dotnet build "MyMicroservice.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "MyMicroservice.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyMicroservice.dll"]
</pre>

<h3>Step 4: Using ASP.NET Core for Web APIs</h3>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> I aimed to create RESTful APIs for each microservice.</p>
<pre>
// Here's an example of how I created a simple API controller in ASP.NET Core
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class OrdersController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable&lt;Order&gt; GetOrders()
    {
        return new List&lt;Order&gt; { /* ... */ };
    }
}
</pre>

<h3>Step 5: Deploying to AWS using EKS and AWS Lambda</h3>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> I wanted to deploy the containerized microservices to AWS.</p>
<ol>
    <li>I set up an Amazon EKS cluster.</li>
    <li>I deployed each microservice using kubectl or AWS CLI.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 6: Using AWS Services</h3>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> My aim was to integrate AWS services for data storage, messaging, caching, and monitoring.</p>
<ol>
    <li>I used Amazon RDS for databases.</li>
    <li>I utilized Amazon S3 for object storage.</li>
    <li>I integrated Amazon SQS for message passing.</li>
    <li>I leveraged Amazon ElastiCache for caching.</li>
    <li>I set up Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 7: Implementing the Bulkhead Pattern</h3>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> I intended to improve system resilience by isolating resources used by each microservice.</p>
<pre>
// Here's an example of how I used the Bulkhead pattern in .NET Core with Polly
var bulkheadPolicy = Policy.BulkheadAsync(2, 4); // 2 concurrent executions, 4 queueing actions

await bulkheadPolicy.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
{
    // Code that runs inside the bulkhead
});
</pre>

<h3>Step 8: Implementing Service Discovery</h3>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> My goal was to use Amazon Route 53 for dynamic discovery of services.</p>
<ol>
    <li>I configured Route 53 to manage DNS for microservices.</li>
    <li>I set up service discovery in the application code.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The result of my efforts was a successful transformation of a legacy application into a scalable, resilient, and maintainable cloud-native architecture using C#, .NET Core, and AWS. By taking a thoughtful approach to microservices, containerization, and cloud-native patterns, I was able to leverage the full benefits of modern cloud computing.</p>
