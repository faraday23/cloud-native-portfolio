<h2>Situation:</h2>
<p>At my previous job at a large e-commerce company, we had an aging monolithic application that was increasingly becoming a bottleneck for us. The application was struggling to handle the growing traffic, new feature additions were slow due to massive codebase, and the entire application had to be scaled even if only one feature was under high-load.</p>

<h2>Task:</h2>
<p>As the Senior DevOps Engineer, my task was to guide the transition from monolithic to a microservices architecture. I was responsible for redesigning the architecture, setting up new CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring zero downtime during the transition.</p>

<h2>Action:</h2>
<p>I started by breaking down the monolithic application into separate services, based on business capabilities. We used Docker to containerize the new microservices, allowing for isolation and consistency across all environments.</p>

<p>Next, I set up Github Actions for CI/CD. For each microservice, individual pipelines were established, allowing for faster, independent deployments.</p>

<p>I then implemented Kubernetes for orchestration of these containers - providing automated deployment, scaling, and management of the microservices.</p>

<h2>Issue/Problem:</h2>
<p>One major challenge was managing the inter-service communication. Services needed a way to discover and communicate with each other securely and efficiently, and the overhead of managing network requests across numerous microservices was becoming complex.</p>

<h2>Resolution:</h2>
<p>To resolve this, I implemented a service mesh using Linkerd. It provided us with robust service discovery, load balancing, and encrypted communication between services. Linkerd also generated detailed telemetry and logs which were instrumental in monitoring and debugging our new architecture.</p>

<p>In addition to Istio, we introduced an API Gateway to manage client requests. Instead of clients being aware of all services, they communicated only with the API Gateway, which then routed the requests to appropriate services.</p>

<h2>Result:</h2>
<p>After moving from a monolith to microservices, we had more scalable and reliable systems where updates and new feature development were quicker and easier to manage. There was minimal downtime during the transition, and issues could be troubleshooted on a service level, reducing the blast radius of incidents. Moreover, our ability to handle traffic loads improved due to more targeted scaling capabilities. The shift affirmed the benefits of microservices when managing expansive, high-traffic applications.</p>
