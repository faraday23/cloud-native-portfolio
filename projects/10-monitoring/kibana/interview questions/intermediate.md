Expert Role: Kibana Instructor

Objective: To provide 10 in-depth comprehensive intermediate-level Kibana interview questions along with sample answers for a devops position interview.

Response:

Here are some possible questions and answers for the objective:

- How do you use the Visualize app to create and manage visualizations in Kibana? What are some common visualization types that you use and what do they show?

  - To use the Visualize app to create and manage visualizations in Kibana, we need to navigate to the Visualize app from the sidebar menu. We can then click on the Create visualization button to create a new visualization, or click on the Open button to open an existing visualization. We can also import or export visualizations using the Import or Export buttons.
  - To create a new visualization, we need to choose a visualization type from the list of options, such as Area, Bar, Line, Pie, etc. We can then choose an index pattern that contains the data that we want to visualize, such as logs-*, metrics-*, etc. We can then configure the visualization using various options and parameters, such as buckets, metrics, axes, labels, colors, etc. We can also use the search bar, filters, time picker, etc. to interact with the data and refine the visualization.
  - To manage an existing visualization, we can use various options and buttons, such as Save, Share, Inspect, Refresh, etc. We can also edit or delete a visualization using the Edit or Delete buttons. We can also add a visualization to a dashboard using the Add to dashboard button.
  - Some common visualization types that we use and what they show are:
    - Area: A visualization that shows the trend or change of a metric over time using stacked or overlapping areas. It can also show the proportion of different categories or groups within the metric. For example, we can use an area chart to show the total bytes sent by different hosts over time.
    - Bar: A visualization that shows the comparison or distribution of a metric across different categories or groups using vertical or horizontal bars. It can also show the breakdown of different subcategories or subgroups within each bar. For example, we can use a bar chart to show the count of HTTP status codes by response time ranges.
    - Line: A visualization that shows the trend or change of a metric over time using lines. It can also show the correlation or relationship between two or more metrics using multiple lines. For example, we can use a line chart to show the average CPU usage and memory usage of a server over time.
    - Pie: A visualization that shows the proportion or percentage of different categories or groups within a metric using slices of a circle. It can also show the breakdown of different subcategories or subgroups within each slice. For example, we can use a pie chart to show the percentage of web traffic by browser type and version.
