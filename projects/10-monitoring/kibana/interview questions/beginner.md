   - Sample answer: Some key features of Kibana that I find highly useful are its ability to create interactive dashboards, explore data in real-time, perform advanced data analysis, and the visualization capabilities like pie charts, bar graphs, heat maps, and geographical maps.

3. **How is Kibana used to visualize data in Elasticsearch?**
   - Sample answer: Kibana allows users to create visualizations by selecting the type of graph they desire, and then linking it to one or more Elasticsearch indices. The data in the indices can be filtered and displayed on the chosen visualization. Also, multiple visualisations can be aggregated into dashboards.

4. **Can you explain the basic architecture or components of Kibana?**
   - Sample answer: Kibana’s basic architecture includes Elasticsearch as its data source, Kibana Server that provides Kibana UI access, and Kibana UI where users interact with their data. Kibana UI has several features including Discover for exploring data, Visualize to create visualizations, Dashboards for creating comprehensive data views, and Management for managing Kibana settings.

5. **Can you describe what a Kibana dashboard is and why it's useful?**
   - Sample answer: A Kibana dashboard is a collection of visualizations, metrics, and maps, typically in real-time. It’s a user-friendly interface that provides you with various views of your datasets. Its usefulness comes from its ability to aggregate varied information into a single panel, allowing insights to be drawn at a glance.

6. **How does Kibana query data that is stored in Elasticsearch?**
   - Sample answer: Kibana uses Elasticsearch's API to run queries, aggregations, suggestions, and more. Kibana allows you to input search queries in the Discovery tab, use filters, or even run a script to process data.

7. **Could you talk about a specific time you've used Kibana in a past project or role?**
   - Sample answer: In a previous role, I used Kibana for log analysis and to visualize time-series data. It was crucial in identifying trends in web traffic, error logs, and also for alerting on system metrics via visualizations on a comprehensive dashboard.
