The comprehensive guide to configuring and collecting metrics, logs, and traces with Datadog involves multiple steps, including the installation of Datadog agents, integration with various systems and services, and understanding how data is ingested and processed. Here is a step-by-step walkthrough.

**1. Creating a Datadog Account:**

Create an account at https://www.datadoghq.com/ if you haven't already done so. Datadog offers a free trial for new users, which should suffice for learning and testing purposes.

**2. Installing the Datadog Agent:**

The Datadog Agent is a software that collects metrics, traces, logs, and other data from your servers and sends this data to Datadog. You must install this agent on every server you wish to monitor. 

Installation instructions vary based on the OS of the server. For Ubuntu, the command would be:

```bash
DD_AGENT_MAJOR_VERSION=7 DD_API_KEY=<your_datadog_api_key> DD_SITE="datadoghq.com" bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/master/cmd/agent/install_script.sh)"
```

Replace `<your_datadog_api_key>` with your actual Datadog API key, which you can find in the Datadog app in the Integrations > APIs section.

**3. Configuring the Agent to Collect Metrics, Logs, and Traces:**

The Datadog Agent comes pre-packaged with hundreds of integrations for popular services and software. You can configure these integrations by updating the appropriate configuration files found in the `/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/` directory.

For example, to collect system metrics (like CPU usage, memory usage, etc.), you would need to enable the "system" integration by creating a `system.yaml` file in the above directory:

```yaml
init_config:

instances:
  - min_collection_interval: 60
```

To collect logs from your servers, you first need to enable log collection in the `datadog.yaml` file:

```yaml
logs_enabled: true
```

Then, for each integration from which you want to collect logs, you need to update the integration's configuration file to specify which logs to collect. For example, to collect Apache access logs, you would update the `apache.d/conf.yaml` file:

```yaml
logs:
  - type: file
    path: /var/log/apache2/access.log
    source: apache
    sourcecategory: http_web_access
```

Traces are collected from your applications. This typically involves instrumenting your application code to send traces to the Agent. Datadog provides libraries for several popular programming languages. For example, to instrument a Python application, you would first install the `ddtrace` library:

```bash
pip install ddtrace
```

Then, in your application code, you would use the `ddtrace` library to create spans representing the operations you want to trace:

```python
from ddtrace import tracer

@tracer.wrap()
def some_operation():
    # Some code here
```

**4. Integrating Datadog with Popular Frameworks and Services:**

Datadog provides integrations for hundreds of services and frameworks, including AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Elasticsearch, Redis, and more. 

The specifics of setting up each integration will vary. In general, it involves installing the integration using the Datadog Agent, and then configuring the integration by providing connection information and specifying which metrics to collect. For example, to set up the AWS integration:

- Install the integration using the Datadog Agent:

  ```bash
  datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-aws==<

INTEGRATION_VERSION>
  ```

- Create a configuration file `aws.d/conf.yaml` in the `/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/` directory:

  ```yaml
  init_config:

  instances:
    - access_key_id: "<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>"
      secret_access_key: "<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"
      account_id: "<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>"
      role_arn: "<YOUR_ROLE_ARN>"
      filter_tags: []
      collect_cloudwatch_metrics: true
  ```

**5. Understanding Data Ingestion and Processing in Datadog:**

Once the Agent collects metrics, traces, and logs, it sends them to Datadog via an HTTPS connection. This data is then processed, aggregated, and stored by Datadog, ready to be viewed in your dashboards, alerts, and other features. 

Data is retained based on the type of data and your Datadog plan:

- Metrics: High-resolution data is retained for 15 months.
- Traces: Depending on your plan, traces are retained for 15 days to 15 months.
- Logs: Depending on your plan, logs are retained for 1 day to 15 months.

**6. Hands-on Exercise: Configuring and Collecting Diverse Data Types:**

To practice the skills you've learned:

- Set up an environment with diverse types of data. This could be a web application running in a container, using a database and a caching service. You can set this up locally using Docker and Docker Compose.

- Install the Datadog Agent on your Docker host.

- Configure the Agent to collect metrics, logs, and traces from your application, Docker, your database, and your caching service.

- View the collected data in your Datadog dashboard.

Remember, this is a very general overview of using Datadog. The specifics will depend greatly on the details of your environment and what you are trying to achieve with your monitoring.
