  <title>Datadog Incident Management and Synthetic Tests Task</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Situation</h1>
  <p>I was hired as a devops engineer for a company that had a web application running on AKS. The company wanted to use Datadog for incident management to monitor the availability and performance of the web application and respond to incidents quickly and efficiently. The company also wanted to use Datadog's synthetic tests to proactively check the availability of the web application and its dependencies and alert the on-call team if any issues were detected.</p>

  <h1>Task</h1>
  <p>My task was to configure Datadog for incident management and create synthetic tests for the web application. I had to use Datadog's integrations with Kubernetes and Azure Monitor to collect metrics, logs, and traces from the AKS cluster and the web application. I also had to use Datadog's synthetic tests to create HTTP checks and browser tests to simulate user requests and interactions with the web application. I also had to use Datadog's incident management features to set up escalation policies and on-call schedules for the devops team.</p>

  <h1>Action</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>I configured Datadog for incident management by following the Datadog documentation. I installed the Datadog Agent on the AKS cluster nodes using Helm charts and enabled the Kubernetes and Azure integrations. I also enabled the log collection and distributed tracing features of the Datadog Agent. I also configured the web application to send logs and traces to Datadog using Datadog's libraries and frameworks.</li>
    <li>I created synthetic tests for the web application using Datadog's synthetic tests feature. I created HTTP checks to monitor the availability and response time of the web application's API endpoints. I also created browser tests to monitor the functionality and performance of the web application's user interface. I used Datadog's recorder extension to record browser test steps and assertions. I also configured the frequency, locations, tags, and notifications of the synthetic tests.</li>
    <li>I set up escalation policies and on-call schedules for the devops team using Datadog's incident management feature. I created an escalation policy that defined how alerts should be routed to different team members based on their roles and availability. I also created an on-call schedule that defined who was on call at any given time and how they should be notified. I also integrated Datadog with Slack and PagerDuty to enable communication and collaboration during incidents.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Issue/Problem</h1>
  <p>One of the issues or problems that I faced during the task was how to handle flaky or false positive alerts from synthetic tests. Flaky or false positive alerts can occur due to various reasons, such as network issues, temporary glitches, browser compatibility, etc. For example, if a browser test failed due to a slow loading element or a layout change, it could trigger an unnecessary alert and notification.</p>

  <h1>Resolution</h1>
  <p>To resolve this issue or problem:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I decided to use alert conditions and retry logic in synthetic tests to reduce flakiness and false positives. Alert conditions and retry logic include:</li>
    <li>Using alert conditions to specify when an alert should be triggered based on the test status, duration, latency, etc. Alert conditions are configured in Datadog's synthetic test settings.</li>
    <li>Using retry logic to specify how many times a test should be retried before

 triggering an alert. Retry logic is configured in Datadog's synthetic test settings.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Using alert conditions and retry logic in synthetic tests has several advantages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It reduces flakiness and false positives by filtering out transient or irrelevant failures.</li>
    <li>It allows fine-tuning of alert thresholds and frequency based on different scenarios and requirements.</li>
    <li>It improves the reliability and accuracy of synthetic tests and alerts.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To implement alert conditions and retry logic in synthetic tests, I followed these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I added alert conditions to synthetic tests by setting the minimum number of failures, maximum duration, maximum latency, etc. in Datadog's synthetic test settings. For example, I added an alert condition that required at least two consecutive failures before triggering an alert.</li>
    <li>I added retry logic to synthetic tests by setting the number of retries, retry interval, etc. in Datadog's synthetic test settings. For example, I added a retry logic that retried a failed test up to three times with a 10-second interval between each retry.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Result</h1>
  <p>As a result of my actions, I was able to configure Datadog for incident management and create synthetic tests for the web application. I was able to collect metrics, logs, and traces from the AKS cluster and the web application using Datadog's integrations with Kubernetes and Azure Monitor. I was also able to monitor the availability and performance of the web application using Datadog's synthetic tests feature. I was also able to set up escalation policies and on-call schedules for the devops team using Datadog's incident management feature. I was also able to use alert conditions and retry logic in synthetic tests to reduce flakiness and false positives. I received positive feedback from my supervisor and client for my work on the task.</p>

  <h1>Installation and Configuration Steps</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <h2>Install the Datadog Agent on the AKS cluster nodes using Helm charts.</h2>
      <p>Create a new Helm chart repository for Datadog.</p>
      <p>Add the Datadog Helm charts to the repository.</p>
      <p>Create a Kubernetes manifest that deploys the Datadog Agent to the AKS cluster.</p>
      <p>Apply the Kubernetes manifest.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Enable the Kubernetes and Azure integrations in the Datadog Agent.</h2>
      <p>Edit the Datadog Agent configuration file.</p>
      <p>Add the Kubernetes and Azure integrations to the configuration file.</p>
