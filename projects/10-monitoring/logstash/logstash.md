<h2>Task</h2>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> My task was to design and implement a Logstash pipeline that could collect, process, and analyze data from various sources, such as hospital records, contact tracing apps, and social media posts.</p>


<h2>To create the pipeline configuration file</h2>

<p>To create the pipeline configuration file, you can use any text editor to write the input, filter, and output sections for Logstash. For example, you can create a file called <strong>epidemiology.conf</strong> in the <strong>/etc/logstash/conf.d</strong> directory with the following content:</p>

<pre>
<code>
input {
  # Read data from hospital records
  file {
    path => "/path/to/hospital_records.json"
    codec => "json"
    start_position => "beginning"
    sincedb_path => "/dev/null"
    type => "hospital"
  }

  # Read data from contact tracing apps
  file {
    path => "/path/to/contact_tracing.csv"
    codec => "plain"
    start_position => "beginning"
    sincedb_path => "/dev/null"
    type => "contact"
  }

  # Read data from social media posts
  file {
    path => "/path/to/social_media.txt"
    codec => "plain"
    start_position => "beginning"
    sincedb_path => "/dev/null"
    type => "social"
  }
}

filter {
  # Process hospital records
  if [type] == "hospital" {
    # Parse and extract relevant fields from JSON data
    json {
      source => "message"
      remove_field => ["message"]
    }

    # Convert and normalize data types and formats
    mutate {
      convert => {
        "age" => "integer"
        "gender" => "string"
        "symptoms" => "array"
        "test_result" => "boolean"
        "exposure_history" => "array"
      }
      lowercase => ["gender"]
      replace => ["test_result", "%{[test_result][0]}"]
      remove_field => ["@version", "@timestamp", "host", "path"]
    }

    # Enrich data with geographical information
    geoip {
      source => "ip_address"
      target => "geoip"
      fields => ["country_code2", "latitude", "longitude"]
      remove_field => ["ip_address"]
    }
  }

  # Process contact tracing data
  if [type] == "contact" {
    # Parse and extract relevant fields from CSV data
    csv {
      separator => ","
      columns => ["user_id", "contact_id", "contact_date", "contact_duration", "contact_distance"]
      remove_field => ["message"]
    }

    # Convert and normalize data types and formats
    mutate {
      convert => {
        "user_id" => "integer"
        "contact_id" => "integer"
        "contact_date" => "date"
        "contact_duration" => "integer"
        "contact_distance" => "float"
      }
      remove_field => ["@version", "@timestamp", "host", "path"]
    }
  }

  # Process social media posts
  if [type] == "social" {
    # Parse and extract relevant fields from plain text data
    grok {
      match => { 
        "message" => "%{DATA:username}:%{SPACE}%{GREEDYDATA:post}"
      }
      remove_field => ["message"]
    }

    # Convert and normalize data types and formats
    mutate {
      convert => {
        "username" => "string"
        "post" => "string"
      }
      lowercase => ["username"]
      remove_field => ["@version", "@timestamp", "host", "path"]
    }

    # Enrich data with sentiment analysis
    sentiment {
      source_field_name => post
      target_field_name_prefixes = [\"sentiment\"]
      language = \"english\"
      remove_source_field = false
      add_tag = true
      tag_name = \"sentiment\"
      tag_value_prefix = \"sentiment_\"
   }
}
}

output {
  # Send data to Elasticsearch
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
    index => "%{type}-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>This pipeline configuration will read the data from different sources and formats, such as hospital records in JSON, contact tracing apps in CSV, and social media posts in plain text. It will then process and transform the data according to the requirements of the study, such as parsing and extracting relevant fields, converting and normalizing data types and formats, enriching the data with geographical information and sentiment analysis. It will then send the data to Elasticsearch with different indices based on the type of the data.</p>
