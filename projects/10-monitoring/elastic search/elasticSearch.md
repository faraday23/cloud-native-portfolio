  <p><strong>Task:</strong> The main challenge was to provide timely and accurate insights and reports on the epidemiological trends and patterns of the diseases and outbreaks. Given the dynamic and complex nature of the data and the public health scenarios, my task was focused on enhancing the analytical capabilities and the reporting functionalities of the system.</p>


<h2>Step 1: Install Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana</h2>

<p>To install Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, you can use the official repositories or download the packages from the website. For example, on Debian or Ubuntu, you can run the following commands:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# Add Elasticsearch repository
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list

# Install Elasticsearch
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install elasticsearch

# Install Logstash
sudo apt-get install logstash

# Install Kibana
sudo apt-get install kibana
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Step 2: Configure Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana</h2>

<p>To configure Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, you can edit the configuration files in the /etc directory. For example, you can edit the /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml file to set the cluster name, node name, network host, and port for Elasticsearch. You can also edit the /etc/logstash/logstash.yml file to set the pipeline configuration and output settings for Logstash. You can also edit the /etc/kibana/kibana.yml file to set the server host, port, and base path for Kibana.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Start Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana</h2>

<p>To start Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, you can use the systemctl command. For example, you can run the following commands:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# Start Elasticsearch
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch

# Start Logstash
sudo systemctl start logstash

# Start Kibana
sudo systemctl start kibana
</code>
</pre>

<p>You can also check the status of each service using the systemctl status command.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Ingest and process the data using Logstash</h2>

<p>To ingest and process the data using Logstash, you can create a pipeline configuration file that defines the input, filter, and output plugins for Logstash. For example, you can create a file called epidemiology.conf in the /etc/logstash/conf.d directory with the following content:</p>

<pre>
<code>
input {
  # Read data from a CSV file
  file {
    path => "/path/to/epidemiology.csv"
    start_position => "beginning"
    sincedb_path => "/dev/null"
  }
}

filter {
  # Parse CSV columns into fields
  csv {
    separator => ","
    columns => ["date", "country", "disease", "cases", "deaths"]
  }

  # Convert fields to appropriate data types
  mutate {
    convert => {
      "date" => "date"
      "cases" => "integer"
      "deaths" => "integer"
    }
  }

  # Calculate case fatality rate as a percentage
  ruby {
    code => "event.set('cfr', (event.get('deaths').to_f / event.get('cases').to_f * 100).round(2))"
  }
}

output {
  # Send data to Elasticsearch
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
    index => "epidemiology-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
    document_id => "%{date}-%{country}-%{disease}"
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>This pipeline configuration will read the data from a CSV file, parse the CSV columns into fields, convert the fields to appropriate data types, calculate the case fatality rate as a percentage, and send the data to Elasticsearch.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Index and store the data using Elasticsearch</h2>

<p>To index and store the data using Elasticsearch, you can use the default settings or customize them according to your needs. For example, you can create an index template that defines the mappings and settings for your epidemiology indices. You can use the following command to create an index template called epidemiology_template:</p>

<pre>
<code>
curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/_template/epidemiology_template?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "index_patterns": ["epidemiology-*"],
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "number_of_replicas": 0
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "date": {
        "type": "date",
        "format": "yyyy-MM-dd"
      },
      "country": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "disease": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "cases": {
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "deaths": {
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "cfr": {
        "type": "float"
      }
    }
  }
}
'
</code>
</pre>

<p>This index template will apply to all indices that match the pattern epidemiology-*, and will define the data types and settings for each field.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Create visualizations and dashboards using Kibana</h2>

<p>To create visualizations and dashboards using Kibana, you can use the Kibana web interface to access the data in Elasticsearch and create various charts, tables, maps, and other widgets. For example, you can create a dashboard that displays the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A line chart that shows the trend of cases and deaths over time for a selected country and disease</li>
  <li>A pie chart that shows the distribution of cases and deaths by disease for a selected country and time range</li>
  <li>A table that shows the top 10 countries with the highest case fatality rate for a selected disease and time range</li>
  <li>A map that shows the geographic distribution of cases and deaths by country for a selected disease and time range</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use the Kibana visualization editor to create each visualization, and then add them to a dashboard. You can also use the Kibana dashboard editor to arrange and customize the dashboard layout. You can also use the Kibana filters, queries, and time picker to interact with the dashboard and explore the data.</p>
