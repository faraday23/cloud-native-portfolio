1. **Question:** Can you explain how Elastic Search works and its role in search and data analysis?

   *Sample Answer:* Elastic Search is a distributed search and analytics engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a scalable search solution and has the ability to index many types of content. Its distributed nature allows it to handle large-scale search operations across a broad range of structured and unstructured data. This makes Elastic Search excellent for log or event data analysis.

2. **Question:** How does Kibana assist with data visualization in Elastic Stack?

   *Sample Answer:* Kibana is a data visualization dashboard for Elasticsearch. It provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed in an Elasticsearch cluster, including line graphs, bar graphs, pie charts, heatmaps, and more. Users can create visualizations and arrange them in dashboards for in-depth data analysis.

3. **Question:** How do you use Logstash in conjunction with Elastic Search and Kibana?

   *Sample Answer:* Logstash acts as a centralized data processing mechanism in Elastic Stack. It dynamically ingests data from a variety of sources, transforms it, and ships it to a variety of destinations including Elastic Search. Once data is pushed to Elastic Search, Kibana dashboards can visualize and analyze that data.

4. **Question:** How did you configure Logstash to ingest data from .NET microservices?

   *Sample Answer:* We configured Logstash to use Azure Event Hub and Redis input plugins to consume data from .NET microservices. The microservices logged structured data to Redis and Azure Event Hub, which Logstash would then fetch for further processing.

5. **Question:** Could you elaborate on how you used the Elastic Search output plugin in Logstash?

   *Sample Answer:* The Elastic Search output plugin in Logstash was used to send the processed data from Logstash to Elastic Search. This plugin facilitated the indexing of data into Elastic Search using configurable mappings, templates, and pipelines.

6. **Question:** How did you configure Kibana to connect to Elastic Search and create data dashboards?

   *Sample Answer:* We configured Kibana by updating its configuration file with the Elastic Search instance details. Once connected, we created various visualizations and dashboards based on the ingested data using Lens, Discover, Maps, Canvas, and Alerts in Kibana for data analysis.

7. **Question:** Can you describe another use case where you used the Elastic Stack?

   *Sample Answer:* Besides log analytics, we used Elastic Stack for real-time application monitoring. Using Beats, we collected system and application level metrics and sent them to Elastic Search. Through Kibana, we then monitored the performance of our applications in almost real-time.

8. **Question:** How did you ensure high availability and failure resilience within Elastic Search?

   *Sample Answer:* We used Elastic Search’s in-built features like sharding and replication. Sharding helped us distribute and parallelize operations across shards to improve performance, while replication ensured high availability of data in case of a node failure.

9. **Question:** How did you manage version control and data retention in Elastic Search?

   *Sample Answer:* Elastic Search doesn't really provide a traditional versioning system. However, each document has a version number that is automatically incremented whenever we make an update. For data retention, we used ElasticSearch’s Index Lifecycle Management feature which automatically manages indices from creation to deletion, according to policies we defined.

10. **Question:** How specific can Kibana get with its visualization and what kinds of alerts were you able to set up?

   *Sample Answer:* Kibana's visualizations can be incredibly specific depending on the data indexed on Elastic Search. You can apply multiple filters and aggregations to create complex visual graphs. As for alerts, Kibana's alerting feature monitors changes in our data set over time and sends emails or creates an index when certain conditions are met. For example, an alert could be set up when server CPU usage exceeds a certain level.
