Here are 10 in-depth comprehensive intermediate-level Elasticsearch interview questions along with sample answers:

1. What is the difference between an index and type in Elasticsearch?

An index in Elasticsearch is similar to a database in an RDBMS, while a type is similar to a table. The key differences are:

- An index is the highest level data container in Elasticsearch and stores one or more types. 
- A type defines a structure or schema for the documents inside an index and acts as a namespace.
- A type allows defining different mapping for different types of documents inside the same index.
- From version 6, types have been removed and all documents are stored directly in one index.

2. What are the components of an Elasticsearch cluster?

An Elasticsearch cluster consists of the following components:

- Nodes: Individual Elasticsearch servers, which can be data nodes or client nodes.
- Index: A logical namespace that stores documents of similar type. 
- Shard: A horizontal partition of an index to allow scaling.   
- Replica: Copies of shards for high availability.
- Ingest Pipeline: Prepares data before indexing for parsing and transformations. 
- Cluster: Group of connected nodes that forms a single Elasticsearch instances.

3. What are Elasticsearch ingest pipelines?

- Ingest pipelines allow data transformations before it is indexed. 
- Transformations can be - filtering null/empty values, removing sensitive fields, adding new fields, updating fields, etc.
- Pipelines are configured and then associated with an index.
- When data is indexed into that index, the associated pipeline is executed.
- This helps keep the data parsing logic separate from index logic.

4. What are Elasticsearch document ID's?

- Document ID's uniquely identify documents in an index.
- If no ID is specified while indexing, Elasticsearch generates a UUID for the document.
- User can specify their own ID's while indexing, but they must be alphanumeric and cannot start with _.
- ID's can have a maximum length of 500 characters. 
- Same ID cannot be used for two different documents in the same index.

5. What are Elasticsearch analyzers?

- Analyzers parse text during indexing into tokens to build the inverted index.
- There are different analyzers available for use cases:
    - Standard - default, splits on whitespace, lowercase, some linguistics
    - Simple - split on whitespace, no linguistics
    - Ngram - generate n-grams from words     
    - Custom - define own character filters and tokenizers
- Analyzers are defined in mapping and applied at index time.
- Different analyzers can be used for same field at index and search time.

Hope these answers help! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Objective: To propose 10 in-depth, comprehensive intermediate-level interview questions about Elasticsearch for a DevOps position, along with sample answers.

**Response:**

1. **What is a shard in Elasticsearch, and why are they significant?**
   - Sample answer: A shard in Elasticsearch is a subset of the data in an index. Each shard is in itself a fully functional and independent index that can be hosted on any node in the cluster. Shards are significant as they allow the data to be distributed across multiple nodes, providing reliability, redundancy, and increasing query performance.

2. **What are the standard practices to ensure Elasticsearch's Cluster health?**
   - Sample answer: Steps include monitoring the cluster health regularly, ensuring that the number of replica shards is sufficient for failover, avoiding the split-brain situation by setting the 'discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes' properly, monitoring disk usage, and keeping an eye on JVM heap pressure.

3. **How can you integrate Elasticsearch with other systems like databases or web services?**
   - Sample answer: Elasticsearch does not have built-in integrations for databases or web services. However, Logstash — part of the Elastic stack — can be used to integrate Elasticsearch with other systems. We can also make use of custom scripts or APIs to push or pull data from other systems.

4. **Can you explain the difference between a filter and a query in Elasticsearch?**
   - Sample answer: Both filters and queries help to define certain criteria for searching. The key difference is that queries also calculate a relevance score for how well each found document matches the criteria. Filters, on the other hand, don't calculate the relevance, they only include or exclude documents based on their criteria.

5. **How to scale-out an Elasticsearch Cluster when data/store grows?**
   - Sample answer: You scale out an Elasticsearch cluster by adding more nodes to the cluster and distributing the shards evenly among existing and new nodes. Another technique is to use routing to reduce the number of shards and increase the size of each shard, depending upon the use case.

6. **What is the significance of document types in Elasticsearch?**
   - Sample answer: A document type in a way used to be similar to a table in a relational database, but since 6.x, Elasticsearch has deprecated having multiple types within an index and will be removed entirely in 8.x. So the best practice is to use an index per document type.

7. **Why is mapping important in Elasticsearch and how does it affect searching?**
   - Sample answer: Mapping is the process of defining how a document and its fields are stored and indexed. It's important because it defines the data types (like date, number, string, etc.) for the fields in a document, influences how text is tokenized, and affects search results and relevancy scoring.

8. **How can you increase search speed in Elasticsearch?**
   - Sample answer: Search speed can be enhanced by applying appropriate mappings, avoiding heavy scripts, using filters instead of queries if relevancy score is not needed, using smaller-sized shards, denormalizing data, scaling out with multiple nodes, and updating hardware.

9. **Explain how bulk requests work in Elasticsearch and why are they useful?**
   - Sample answer: Bulk requests in Elasticsearch allow us to send multiple create, index, update, or delete requests grouped together in a single HTTP call. They are useful because they can significantly increase throughput by reducing network overhead.

10. **Can you describe how Elasticsearch security needs to be managed?**
   - Sample answer: Basic Elasticsearch security requires configuring network settings to prevent unauthorized access, enabling HTTPS for encrypted communications, using role-based access control to restrict user access, setting up audit logs to keep track of activities, ensuring regular data backups, and using a security plugin or features like the X-Pack security module.

Possible follow-on questions:

- How would you handle garbage collection issues in Elasticsearch?
- Tell me a time when you had to recover Elasticsearch from a failure.
- How can you manage hot-warm-cold data architectures in Elasticsearch?
- How do you approach troubleshooting slow-running queries in Elasticsearch?
- How would you go about performance monitoring of an Elasticsearch cluster?

Expert Role: Elastic Search Instructor

Objective: To provide 10 in-depth comprehensive intermediate-level Elasticsearch interview questions along with sample answers for a devops position interview.

Response:

Here are some possible questions and answers for the objective:

- How do you perform different types of searches on your data using the Elasticsearch REST API or a query DSL tool? What are some query options and filters that you use to refine your search results?

  - To perform different types of searches on our data using the Elasticsearch REST API or a query DSL tool, we need to use the GET request with the _search endpoint. We can specify the index and type as the endpoint if we want to limit our search to a specific index or type. We can also specify our query in the request body using the query DSL, which is a JSON-based language for expressing queries.
  - For example, we can search for books with the word "galaxy" in their title with the following command:

```
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/books/book/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "galaxy"
    }
  }
}
'
```

  - This will return all the documents of type book in the books index that match the query. It will also return some metadata about the search, such as total hits, max score, took time, etc.
  - We can also use various query options and filters to refine our search results. For example, we can use the size and from parameters to paginate our results, the sort parameter to sort our results by a field or a script, the _source parameter to include or exclude fields from the results, the filter parameter to apply a filter query that does not affect the relevance scores, etc. For example, we can search for books with a rating higher than 4 and sort them by rating in descending order with the following command:

```
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/books/book/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": {
        "range": {
          "rating": {
            "gt": 4
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "sort": [
    {
      "rating": {
        "order": "desc"
      }
    }
  ],
  "_source": [
    "title",
    "author",
    "rating"
  ]
}
'
```

  - This will return only the documents of type book in the books index that have a rating higher than 4, and sort them by rating in descending order. It will also return only the title, author, and rating fields for each document.

- How do you perform different types of aggregations on your data using the Elasticsearch REST API or a query DSL tool? What are some aggregation options and parameters that you use to customize your aggregations?

  - To perform different types of aggregations on our data using the Elasticsearch REST API or a query DSL tool, we need to use the GET request with the _search endpoint. We can specify the index and type as the endpoint if we want to limit our aggregation to a specific index or type. We can also specify our aggregation in the request body using the aggs DSL, which is a JSON-based language for expressing aggregations.
  - For example, we can aggregate the books by genre and get the average rating for each genre with the following command:

```
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/books/book/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "genres": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "genre"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "avg_rating": {
          "avg": {
            "field": "rating"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```

  - This will return an empty hits array and an aggregations object that contains the genres bucket aggregation and the avg_rating metric aggregation. It will also return some metadata about the aggregation, such as doc_count_error_upper_bound and sum_other_doc_count. For example, we can see something like this:

```
{
  "took" : 9,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 2,
    "successful" : 2,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 4,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "genres" : {
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound" : 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count" : 0,
      "buckets" : [
        {
          "key" : "science fiction",
          "doc_count" : 2,
          "avg_rating" : {
            "value" : 4.25
          }
        },
        {
          "key" : "fantasy",
          "doc_count" : 1,
          "avg_rating" : {
            "value" : 4.8
          }
        },
        {
          "key" : "literature",
          "doc_count" : 1,
          "avg_rating" : {
            "value" : 3.9
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

  - We can also use various aggregation options and parameters to customize our aggregations. For example, we can use the size and order parameters to limit and sort the buckets, the include and exclude parameters to filter the buckets by a pattern or a list, the missing parameter to handle documents that do not have a value for the field, etc. For example, we can aggregate the books by genre and get the average rating for each genre, but only include the genres that start with "s" and sort them by average rating in ascending order with the following command:

```
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/books/book/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "genres": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "genre",
        "size": 10,
        "order": {
          "avg_rating": "asc"
        },
        "include": "^s.*"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "avg_rating": {
          "avg": {
            "field": "rating"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```

  - This will return an empty hits array and an aggregations object that contains the genres bucket aggregation and the avg_rating metric aggregation, but only for the genres that start with

  Sure, here are 10 in-depth comprehensive intermediate-level Elasticsearch interview questions along with sample answers for a DevOps position interview:

**Question:** What is the difference between a shard and a replica in Elasticsearch?

**Answer:** A shard is a logical partition of an index in Elasticsearch. A replica is a copy of a shard. Shards are used to distribute data across multiple nodes in an Elasticsearch cluster. Replicas are used to provide redundancy and improve the availability of data.

**Question:** What are the different types of shards in Elasticsearch?

**Answer:** There are two types of shards in Elasticsearch: primary shards and replica shards. Primary shards are the shards that contain the original data. Replica shards are copies of the primary shards.

**Question:** What is the purpose of the cluster health API in Elasticsearch?

**Answer:** The cluster health API in Elasticsearch provides information about the health of an Elasticsearch cluster. This information includes the number of nodes in the cluster, the number of shards, the number of replicas, and the status of each shard.

**Question:** What is the difference between a warm and a hot shard in Elasticsearch?

**Answer:** A warm shard is a shard that is not currently being used. A hot shard is a shard that is currently being used. Warm shards are stored on disk, while hot shards are stored in memory.

**Question:** What is the difference between the term query and the match query in Elasticsearch?

**Answer:** The term query matches documents that contain the specified term. The match query matches documents that contain the specified terms, as well as synonyms and related terms.

**Question:** What is the difference between the range query and the date range query in Elasticsearch?

**Answer:** The range query matches documents that fall within a specified range. The date range query matches documents that fall within a specified date range.

**Question:** What is the difference between the aggregation and the visualization API in Elasticsearch?

**Answer:** The aggregation API in Elasticsearch is used to group and summarize data. The visualization API in Elasticsearch is used to visualize data using charts and graphs.
