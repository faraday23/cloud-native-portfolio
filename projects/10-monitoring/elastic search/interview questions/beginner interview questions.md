Here are 10 in-depth comprehensive beginner Elasticsearch interview questions for a devops position interview:

1. What is Elasticsearch?

   Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. These use cases include full-text search, spatial search, aggregations, etc. It is designed to scale horizontally, has a rich and extensible schema, and supports multiple languages and encodings.

2. What are the main features of Elasticsearch?

   - Full-text search: Ability to search the content of fields 
   - Relevant search results: Ranking of results based on multiple algorithms
   - Speed: Very fast search due to its inverted index data structure  
   - Scalability: Horizontally scalable - can expand on multiple servers
   - High availability: Ability to tolerate individual server failures
   - Geo-search: Spatial search capabilities - finds results within given locations
   - Aggregations: Ability to aggregate and summarize data in various ways

3. How would you describe the architecture of Elasticsearch?

   - Elasticsearch is a distributed system - it can span multiple servers  
   - Each server is called a node - a node can be either a data node or a client node
   - Data nodes store the data and index, while client nodes only route API calls to data nodes 
   - Nodes self-organize into clusters to ensure high availability and scalability
   - Elasticsearch uses the Lucene library to index and search data

4. Explain Shards and Replicas in Elasticsearch

   - Shards are a logical division of an index's data - for performance and availability
   - When an index is created, it can be divided into a specified number of shards 
   - Each shard is an Elasticsearch index that contains a portion of the data
   - Replicas are copies of shards - used for high availability and resilience
   - A replica shard is an exact copy of the original shard - stored on a different node

5. What are tokens in Elasticsearch?

   Tokens are the minimal units of text that Elasticsearch processes. Some key points:

   - Tokens are created during indexing from analyzed text  
   - Tokens are used during search time to match against tokens in the index
   - The process of extracting tokens from text is called tokenization
   - Common tokens are words, numbers, punctuation, emojis, etc.
   - Elasticsearch provides different tokenizers for different use cases

6. Explain Mapping in Elasticsearch

   - Mapping defines how a document, and the fields it contains, are stored and indexed
   - Mapping is similar to a schema or metadata for your data  
   - Mapping defines the type of each field - text, keyword, date, integer, etc.
   - It defines additional attributes like - null value, indexing options, etc.
   - Mapping is done at index creation time, but can also be updated dynamically

7. What is an Inverted Index in Elasticsearch?

   - An inverted index is a core data structure that Elasticsearch uses for retrieving information quickly
   - It maps words/tokens to the document(s) that contain those words/tokens
   - For a given token, the inverted index tells which documents contain that token and where  
    they appear in that document   
   - This inverted index structure makes searching very fast in Elasticsearch

8. Explain Cluster Health in Elasticsearch

   - Cluster health is an important parameter that determines how well an Elasticsearch 
   cluster is performing   
   - Cluster health can be yellow, green or red:
     - Green: All primary and replica shards are allocated
     - Yellow: All primary shards are allocated but some replicas are missing
     - Red: Some primary shards are not allocated
   - Cluster health API also provides detailed information like number of nodes, shards, etc.
   - Administrators monitor cluster health to ensure high performance and availability

9. What is the difference between routing and filtering in Elasticsearch?

   - Routing is used when indexing documents to control which shard a document is mapped to
   - Documents with the same routing value will be indexed on the same shard
   - Routing helps keep related documents close together, improving performance 
   - Filtering is used when searching/querying documents to filter results
   - Only documents matching filter conditions will be returned as search results
   - Filtering does not affect which shards are searched

10. How would you backup and restore an Elasticsearch cluster?

   - Main approaches for Elasticsearch backup:
    - Snapshots - Uses a repository (S3, HDFS, NFS) to store snapshots
    - File copying - Copies all data and config files to backup storage  
    - Remote cluster replication - Replicate to another Elasticsearch cluster

   - To take a snapshot:
     - Create a repository 
     - Take a snapshot naming it appropriately  
     - Store the snapshot in the repository
  
   - To restore from a snapshot:
     - Create an index with the same name
     - Initialize from the snapshot using the snapshot name  
     - Old indexes are replaced and documents restored

Objective: To propose 10 in-depth, comprehensive beginner interview questions about Elasticsearch for a DevOps position, along with sample answers.

**Response:**

1. **Can you describe what Elasticsearch is and what it's commonly used for?**
   - Sample answer: Elasticsearch is a distributed, open-source, full-text search and analytics engine. It's commonly used for log and event data analysis, full-text search, and other use cases where fast, real-time access to data is needed.

2. **How does Elasticsearch store data?**
   - Sample answer: Elasticsearch stores data as JSON documents. These documents are organized into indices, similar to how rows are stored in tables in a relational database. Each index has one or more types, with a type representing a class of similar documents.

3. **How is data distributed across an Elasticsearch cluster?**
   - Sample answer: Data in Elasticsearch is distributed across a cluster using shards. An index is split into multiple shards, and each shard can have zero or more replicas. This helps with load balancing and redundancy.

4. **Can you explain the Elasticsearch inverted index and why it's important for quick full-text searches?**
   - Sample answer: An inverted index in Elasticsearch is a listing of all unique words that appear in any document and identifies each document they appear. It allows you to look up a word and find in which document it appears, enabling fast, full-text searches.

5. **How do you interact with the Elasticsearch API?**
   - Sample answer: I mainly interact with Elasticsearch via its RESTful API, using HTTP requests. I use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Elasticsearch also provides APIs for cluster management and other administrative tasks.

6. **What is Kibana, and how does it integrate with Elasticsearch?**
   - Sample answer: Kibana is an open-source data visualization and exploration tool used for log and time-series analytics and application monitoring. It works seamlessly with Elasticsearch to visualize data and provides features to create advanced, interactive dashboards.

7. **How can we ensure the high availability of data in Elasticsearch?**
   - Sample answer: Elasticsearch increases data availability by using replica shards. Replica shards are copies of primary shards. They provide redundancy, so if a node fails that includes a primary shard, a replica is promoted to the new primary.

8. **Can you explain the role of Elasticsearch in the ELK Stack?**
   - Sample answer: In the ELK Stack, Elasticsearch plays the role of the search and analytics engine. Logstash collects and sends log data to Elasticsearch, and Kibana uses Elasticsearch to visualize the data.

9. **Can you explain how document relevance is determined in Elasticsearch?**
   - Sample answer: Document relevance in Elasticsearch is determined by a scoring algorithm, by default it's "BM25". Higher scores mean higher relevance. Custom scoring functions can also be implemented.

10. **Give an example where you had to optimize Elasticsearch. What strategies did you use?**
   - Sample answer: In a previous role, the search queries were very slow. To optimize, we used the _explain API to see why queries were slow and adjusted the relevancy scoring. We also moved to faster storage, updated our mappings to remove unused fields, and increased the ram for Elasticsearch.

Possible follow-on questions:

- How would you secure your Elasticsearch instances in a production environment?
- Can you describe a challenging problem that you solved using Elasticsearch?
- How would you handle version control for Elasticsearch configuration?
- How do you update the mappings of an Elasticsearch index without disrupting service?
- How do you process and visualize log data using the ELK stack?
