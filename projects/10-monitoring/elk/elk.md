<h2><strong>Situation:</strong></h2>
<p>I was working as a devops engineer for a company that provides a cloud-based software solution for online education. The solution consists of several .NET microservices that handle various functionalities such as course management, student enrollment, video streaming, and quizzes. The microservices are deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters and use Azure SQL Database and Azure Blob Storage for data persistence.</p>

<h2><strong>Task:</strong></h2>
<p>My task was to improve the observability and troubleshooting of the solution by using Elastic Search, Kibana, and Logstash with Azure Kubernetes. Elastic Search is an open source distributed search and analytics engine that can store and query large volumes of structured and unstructured data<sup>[1]</sup>. Kibana is an open source data visualization and exploration tool that works with Elastic Search to provide dashboards, charts, maps, and alerts<sup>[1]</sup>. Logstash is an open source data processing pipeline that can ingest data from multiple sources, transform it, and send it to Elastic Search or other destinations<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>

<h2><strong>Action:</strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I installed Elastic Search, Kibana, and Logstash on a separate AKS cluster using the Elastic Helm charts. The Helm charts enabled me to run the Elastic Stack components with minimal configuration and customization<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I configured Logstash to use Azure Event Hub plugin and Redis input plugin to ingest data from the .NET microservices. Azure Event Hub is a fully managed service that enables data streaming and event ingestion from various sources<sup>[3]</sup>. Redis is an open source in-memory data structure store that can be used as a message broker. The .NET microservices used Serilog library to write structured logs to Redis and Azure Event Hub.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I configured Logstash to use Elastic Search output plugin to send the processed data to Elastic Search. The output plugin enabled Logstash to index the data into Elastic Search with configurable mappings, pipelines, and templates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I configured Kibana to connect to Elastic Search and create dashboards and visualizations for the ingested data. Kibana enabled me to explore and analyze the data using various features such as Lens, Discover, Maps, Canvas, and Alerts.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>Issue/Problem:</strong></h2>
<p>One of the challenges I faced was to ensure that the data was consistent and reliable across different sources and formats. For this, I had to use Logstash filters and codecs to parse, enrich, and transform the data before sending it to Elastic Search.</p>

<h2><strong>Resolution/Result:</strong></h2>
<p>By implementing the task using Elastic Search, Kibana, and Logstash with Azure Kubernetes, I was able to achieve the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I was able to ingest data from various sources such as logs, metrics, events, traces, and messages into a single platform using Logstash plugins.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was able to store and query large amounts of data with high performance and scalability using Elastic Search distributed architecture<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was able to visualize and explore the data using interactive dashboards and charts using Kibana features.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was able to troubleshoot issues and identify trends and patterns using Elastic Search powerful search and analytics capabilities<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
